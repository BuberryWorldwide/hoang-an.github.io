# Waking Up Into World Peace

WAKING UP INTO WORLD PEACE


     I woke up and heard a chorus of joyous shoutings. The happiest of sounds came from all directions around outside.  It takes sometimes for me to really be captivated by the uniformity of the most delightful expression of human emotions. There are pure laughters and a most fantastic sound screaming out the words,  "World peace has come!!" by an excited crowd. Cars are honking, church bells all over the city rang at peak joy. So, World War III had ended finally. It was a strangest feeling to have gone to sleep and woke up into a totally different state of the globe: world peace..!!

     My roommate banged o­n my door and shouted: "Wake up..!!  How can you sleep?" She opened the door and ran in like a tornado. I asked her, "What's this about world peace?"  My roommate answered excitedly:  "Yes! All the nations with mighty arsenal had signed a treaty to totally dismantle all weapons and the "concepts of war!"  "Jesus..!!"  "Exactly..!!"
