# Literary Beings

Hoàng-Ân


Literary Beings

(we can go o­n rationalizing about
 broken promises but it really is
 very painful to experience them.)


following the dot of ink
through the wilderness of utter sorrow.
following the semicolon of logic
through the aching void of intelligence.
following the period of finally hope renewal
throught the desert of bruised hearts.
following the thought of a dangling modifier
through the pain of utter confusion.
forllowing a poem
through the jungles of broken promises...

How is it to be alive
is to read a classical tragedy
And o­nce refused to act
the senses grow numb!

And to be human is to have
a body
that makes real
the Self
than all
the chairs in the
empty Theatre...
