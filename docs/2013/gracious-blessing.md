# Gracious Blessing

Gracious Blessing


Take me to the shore by the still water
Bless me like the wind that sing with the waves
I'll sit so still to feel the gladful fishes' joy
Jumping high into the air above their wet cool home
And hear the triumphant cries of the hawks and the eagles
When their wings flare in gladful flight
Snatching their meals where the air and the water meet.
I will stay to watch how dawn wakes up with delight
Till twightlight dims after the glorious dying light has ceased.
Dream with me when the moon travels with fidelity
Her milky face bathes space with silvery caresses
I will lie down upon the patient sands
Look up to join with the laughing stars
Can't help but twinkle their dimples with mirth
Come inside me and fill up all the empty space
As I feel your presence in the sobbing sounds of my separate selves.
