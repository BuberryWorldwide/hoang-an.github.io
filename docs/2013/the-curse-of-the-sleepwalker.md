# The Curse of The Sleep-Walker

The Curse of the Sleep-Walker

(" Whatever gets you through the night,
    It's alright! It's alright!
    Whether it's wrong, or it's right,
    It's alright! It's alright!"
                    (John Lennon))
................................................................


When you dream a little bit too much
and your dreams betray you
You become a sleepwalker
and all dreams become hallucinations,
The lives people are living
especially of those who are closest to you
    become lies!
The fact that they do live them sincerely
    to the utmost
Only intensifies your disillusionment!
In the end it all boils down to
the choices that people make,
However for some it's harder to choose
Because all boundaries between the relative truths
have been blurred
and the Absolute is deemed nonsensible:

Ahhh..!!...the curse of a sleepwalker..!!

 the soul and poetry into psychiatry.)
