# Come Without A Promise

Hoàng-Ân

Came Without A Promise
Went Without A Vow



With no expectations..or so I hope: I come empty-handed except the fact that my hands are opening upward..Innocent still with fresh childlike wonders to hold that warm sun of a rising Dawn of a dream for a relative utopia amidst the facts-of-life.

With no judgment..or so I aim: I come with some baggages because who among us are without wounds and scars?? But my eyes can still see the boundless starry deep long night night-sky with starry smiles (of a Little Prince)/reaching out...some boldly, with youthful courage not a few, full of hesitancy because past hurts have scarred their winged hearts: Yet, to still reaching out is admirringly hopeful and contained folkore faith.

With much sincerity and honest belief in Life: I am coming to You without a promise..but with full acceptance and not a little of unconditional Love. We might o­ne day leave each other so there is no need for a vow..!! The stars simmerring are lighted long after their bodies have ceased:

For Love is more hopeful than promises and Love is more abiding than any vows..!!
