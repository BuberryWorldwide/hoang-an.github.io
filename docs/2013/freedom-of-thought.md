# freedom of thought

Hoang-An

freedom of thought


drip
drop
drip
drop

splatterily sing
splatterily dance
drops of living water
fall and purify
all the dusts of yesterday.

syllables serve to
make words
words serve to
make thoughts
thoughts serve
to express
the freedom to affect
how the globe is to be
protected:
for we are
the stewards of the universe!

ain't no way we can deny
it's freedom of thought
that determines and defines
the humaness of a
perfect machine:
us the perfect machines..!!

outside it's raining
inside it's warming
for i am sitting in a room
making up poems and letters
as the exercising of my right
and privilege and honor
to be a global citizen:

and for me to enjoy
being a person with words
many are actually
serving o­n the fronts
in hostile lands overseas
to protect exactly that freedom:

all other letters of freedom
begin with the freedom of thought
just imagine how hideous
are the shadows that've always
been trying to destroy
what is beautiful and pure!

sing, dance, write, speak
we deserve to absolutely
express ourselves
just simply because
it is beautiful for us to do so:

for such an ideological beauty
we fight: for ourselves and
our global posterity...

i celebrate us
you celebrate me:
with the Word-make-Flesh
that's true love,
that's wisdom..!!

by using the words
we glorify the freedom
most sacred of all:
the freedom of thought..!!
