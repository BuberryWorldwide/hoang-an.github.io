# Please Tread Softly

Hoang-An

Please Tread Softly


There are so much pains and suffering
in the world: and inside my own home
That make me squirm like a worm,
sometimes...
And in such moments
I just want to be alone..!!
To hide inside the house
with all the blinds drawn shut
Even music posed such a challenge
to listen to..!!

When all the noises from outside
ceased in the dark of night,
The sounds of the engines of the
refrigerator, heater,
and the clock tick tock tick tock
hung in mid-air:
Suddenly, I understood what it means
to hear the sound of silence:

In that silence time appeared to float
like cigarrette smoke,
twirling and churning
making out the forms of the air currents;
I allowed myself to close my eyes
and praying that my heart would be soften
enough:
so I can have a good cry..!!

The pain..!! Ahhh, the pain
That kind of pain that the old folks
borne silently: so much so
It is just purely phenomenon..!!

Pain from death! Pain from life!
Pain from truths! Pain from lies!
Pain from hatred! Pain from love!
Pain from aloneness! Pain from loneliness!
Pain from betrayals! Pain from betraying!
Pain from words that kill!
Pain from fists! Pain from guns!
Pain from abandonment! Pain from being forsaken!
Pain from selflessness! Pain from selfishness!
Pain from caring too much!
Pain from no longer wanting to care!

When I love: this is what I feel it to be like:
It is like I am tip-toeing o­n broken glass
each piece of them can pierce my flesh
and leave a wound o­n the sole of my feet!
It is like a young new mother
waking up in the middle of the night
she keeps going into the nursery room
to check to be certain
that her child is still breathing!

Pain makes everything seem
so fragile:
And sometimes I lose my mind
In feeling such ephemeralness
can imbue such power of foreverness
in me..!!

So please tread softly,
Every time you enter my world:
Be certain,
I have always been waiting for You!
And if my love should hurt you,
And if my wound should cut you:
I will tread ever so softly,
upon the story of your world..!!

Ohhh...please tread softly..!!
Ohhh...please tread softly..!!
