# Into Spring

Hoàng-Ân

Into Spring


Don't lead the music
only let the music guide you
You will see the tender grass and purple daisies
dotting the verdant vista
You will feel the lustful leaves bound thirsty summer
You will be colored by the golden and moroon hues
dipping by autumn's dawns and dusks
And winter snows and icycles
will leave you a sensibility of Life's patience
    as the God of the seasons
    silently mystifying our
    o­neness
    into another spring.
