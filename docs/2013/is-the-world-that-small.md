IS THE WORLD THAT SMALL..?!

"Is the world that small?!"

While my mind is exploding like a Big Bang
amidst abundance with the wondrousness
of existential bliss:
(which is where and how you should be too,
and doing exactly what you should also be
doing all the time,)
I'm knee-deeped in political s_ _t..!!

...My friend lamented: And the tube keeps
blazing away with those mournful and
indescribable innocent looks unbelievably
still retaining in the eyes of children and
orphants of the third world; ("accidences"
for lack of electricity and entertainment
while waiting for an honest job and
"Peace-for-our-fatherland") their stomachs
protruding with parasites and heads the bodies
scarely able to hold up, naked or without pants.
(And some of my friends acclaim: not an
infinitestimal effort is made to be more considerate
for people's aesthetical sensibility for order.)

Then comes the famous plea:
"For the price of a cup of coffee a day (they
calculate) you can save..."

Suddenly I have been caught off guard at the scene of the blood-and-mud caked corpses
of four foreign correspondent journalists and a camera-man, lying o­n the gravel road
along side banana-leaved and sugarcaned fields...(Wasn't this the theme being
exploited for exotic sweaty sex scenes in best-seller paperback romance novels and box-
office movies???)

They got caught between an imagined line: a line, the line, the dividing line of taking sides:
their desire: To record history for future mankind and save their human race from
repeating past mistakes as time yields the judgment of history through the patience of
long-suffering Time..!!!

All the while,
The archeologists and anthropologists,
funded by the freeworld governments of the left,
or non-profited private cultural sectors and the
leftist regimes for "cultural propaganda"
(...Cry fouled,
the exiled activists and the pacifists..!!)
keep digging away at ancient tombs far deeper
into the god-forsakened wasted lands to
unearth claybaked vessels, pagan charms and
fossils of bones or mumies blown bared
by desert sandstorms; or tracing after
the Garden of Eden somewhere in Iraq.

How much more can it be avoided
to jargonize the confused, shaded question,

"Is this morally correct..!?!?"

"Don't go there!"
the pathetic crowd pat pityingly the concerners.
But the tubes are blazing still the question amidst
the tribal wars of nations
while children turn orphants are starving for
food and love!
And if they should grow into adults,
martyrdom can deem such a much better world..!!
