The Strong Silent Presence


Strong and Silent
Your Presence
         in my life
         my stormy
         inner world.

Always,
Yield such strength
         a pillar
         a simmer
            warmth
         of the hearth
         fire flame
burning soft and tender.

Inside of me,
An unfathomable, bottomless
wild ocean of dark storms
rages relentlessly
My small boat crosses it
My sail is thin and weak
The wind and waves
forever directionless:

But Your Ever Silent Presence
lies deep within my Heart
that is hidden inside
the embrace of my
enclosed chest:
This is my Destination
and I no longer
afraid of being lost!

I am already: HOME..!!
