QUEEN OF HEART,

MOONCHILD...............................................

...................................................................


Queen of Heart, golden moonchild
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
Enfold me within the embrace of your gentle voice
Sing your song: soft and low
Draw me into the magic of the night
Queen of Heart, golden moonchild
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
The night is deep, the stars are few
loneliness is deep, loneliness is strong
Enfold me within the embrace of your gentle voice
sing golden moon child: magical and full of fairy tales
The dawn is far and my soul is hungry
Touch me deep, touch me slow
Queen of Heart, goldern moonchild
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
The night is deep, the stars are few
loneliness is deep, loneliness is strong
Sing your song, soft and low
Draw me into the magic of the night
Hold me tight, love me strong
I can see you in my burning dreams
Hold me tight, love me strong
Enfold me in your generous arms
I need you
tonight
Draw me into the magic of your might
Queen of Heart, golden moonchild
Soft of breasts, kind of arms.
