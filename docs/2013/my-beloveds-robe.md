# My Beloved's Robe

Hoàng-Ân

My Beloved's Robe


God has shown me perfection
in my Beloved:
All my hunger and thirst
have been satisfied;
All my spiritual aspirations
have been fulfilled:
In my Beloved's psalms and hymns..!!

So long ago,
My winters have been called:
     "loneliness"
     "desperation"
     "discontentment"
     "lost!"

Now: no matter the
how; what; where; when; why
I have touched my
      "the vision!"

And so:
I paint a wide garment of plain grained-cloth
to make a rope for my Beloved to wear,
The simple yet intricate play
of colors and court designs
They contrast yet complimenting
by blending into each other:
       like my breath and his
       sharing the same universe!

The robe shall flow
like the seas rain down
the springs of the mountains.
The colors shall shine
as bright as the cause
my Beloved so passionately served.
The grains of the plain cloth
is true and pure as his truth
straight and simple and direct
as the arrow o­nce been shot
with the force of the just and true!

So I paint a wide garment of cloth
To make a robe for my Beloved to wear
And when they see him wearing it
They would see the precious
      innocent vision of
      a child.
