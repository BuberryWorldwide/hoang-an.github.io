# Waiting To Be Awakened

WAITING TO BE AWAKENED

      My Beloved!

      I ask not that you are perfect, o­nly that you love me for myself. I know not if because I have not yet met you so I trust that I don't have a mold to fit you into my discerned standard accordingly to my own convenience. Nevertheless, I must have some unrealized expectations for a lover??

     Then, my ambition is not to be satisfied, because the Ideal in the human relative world is not realistic. Humans are not perfect, else we would be GOD ourselves: and because of our imperfection we are not infallible, and sooner or later in our attempt to converse, we will fail each other!

      O­nly humble souls can attained something closest to bliss. I, however, give myself the permission to believe in an Ideal that is shared among us comprades as a bridge connecting our souls. I am changing all the time so I will constantly evolve into newness; it's my essence that remains the same: it is this that asked to be awaken by you: the first kiss of all fairy tales!!
