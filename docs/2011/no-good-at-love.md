# No Good At Love

No Good At Love

You said you wanted me to stay
     still hoping for another day
But as I turned you heard me say:
     " I am no good at love!"

Still, with my heart I made so free
     expecting love accordingly
But now I KNOW that cannot be,
     " I am no good at love!"

     I am no good, I'm too intense
     to turn my passion into sense
     nor ever proud enough to be
     like those who take love carelessly
     " I am no good at love!"

There're different kinds of loneliness
The kind you make yourself's the best
     I know because I've tried the rest
     " I am no good at love!"

And when self-pity makes me pray
     for all the love you threw away
Here in sweet solitude I'll say:
     " I am no good at love!"
