# Go From My Window

Go From My Window

Go from my window, my love, my doves
     go from my window, my dears
For the wind is from the west and the cuckoo's in her nest
     and you can't have a lodging here.

Go from my window my love, my doves
     go from my window, my dears
For the weather it is warm and it will never do you harm
     and you can't have a lodging here.

Go from my window my love, my dove
     go from my window, my dear:
O, the wind and the rain have fetched him back again
     but he can't have a harboring here

Go from my window, my love, my dove
     go from my window, my dear
O the devil's in the moon and is in the man
     he will not understand
     that he can't have a lodging here

Go from my window, my love, my dove
     Time is bidding me to
     Fare thee well..!!
