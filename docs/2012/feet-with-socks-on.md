# Feet With Socks On

FEET WITH SOCKS o­n

.............................Hoàng-Ân......................


Boddha Dahrma scratched
his disciples'
souls.

But my feet stuck to my socks
and the itches in my brain
get no relief
from my numbed fingers!

Todd Rundgren sang, "Izzat Love"
I can barely remember
what it is like to be in loved!
An old friend told me,
There are many ways to love
And that there are as many kinds of love!
Is "true love" an oxymoron??

It's just that
I want so to
feel:

.....Only,
Oh! So heavy
my shoes..!!
