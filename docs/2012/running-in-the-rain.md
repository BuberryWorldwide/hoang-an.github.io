# Running In The Rain

Hoàng-Ân

Running In The Rain


We'll learn how to run
When the rain comes
We'll run loose and wild
We'll learn the true meaning of freedom
Dancing in the torid rain
Singing from the gut in the cool water

Ahhh...We're a strange pair
You always yearn to sail your kite into the sunshine
I'm forever longing to hide in the darkness of the night
You like to play with the crowd
I prefer to have you all to myself
You like to chase after originality
I want to dig deep into the clarity of a vision

You are running free in the wilderness of life
Chasing after the elusive aim of attaining meanings
I have just landed upon the shore of a home
And the storms you enjoy riding
Are the landscape of fears I seek to be sheltered from..!!

But it is a universal law
That time forever marches forward
In the autumn of our lives
You and I will meet upon the brink of understanding
We will talk of the confusing uncertainties of today
Like telling stories full of emotional climaxes.

And as we sip the new wine
We will remember our now as if recalling a harvest of the grapes..!!
