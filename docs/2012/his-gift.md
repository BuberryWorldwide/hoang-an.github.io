HIS GIFT


     His Gift ...oh Life, soaks with Tender Love, how bountiful!
     ...She lies o­n the silent shifting warm-blooded sands: Opening arms, palms upward like the face of the earth...waiting to be pierced with his glance: The stars, oh, the stars: wondrously sparkling, scintillating with wisdom of immortality...Her precious dreams above the inner core of fire like smoke churn; and like smoke dissipate: the spirit floats out of the urn of the heart: churning, churning: within His universe: paying obesance unto His humble heart and His Will like Truth, glorifying silently.

Her totality of being rejoicing into the firmament between the upper and lower realms of the living water. His presence hoovers yonder the face of determinent chaos: in the beginning with soft molds of moles of molecules start chatting like rebels. His feeling lies deep in the contemplation of coalesting boulders...What comes last to be the first but the fire of vocanic eruption under the sea?

"Faith and the Surrenderer": Destiny appears, thick as mud in a pond of exploding petals of lotus blossoming in deep meditation into summer dreams...wading the unconscious consciousness, wading proud like a sojourner learns to doubt all in order to know "that" Truth.
      ...Moving in the plate of silver, that moon, the circle face of milk. Slowly, hands cupping in the light, reality dims and flowers smile shyly yet full of mirth...veiling the womb of the first fruit: the creation of the first composition that can cry, Eve, the wooer of Man!
      ...Laboring hard to give the whole manifestation of complexity...her immense spirit, soothes His delight in the knowledge of her unknowableness...Swirl o­n, oh, please, the relic of past innocence in the mind of an infant!

   Man in deep slumber, the resting restlessness of the urge to know the unknowable...And the stars forever shining in oblivious joy, disclaiming sounds except with the heart's longing...When He wakes, another world has been born through the forgotten dreams in the ink jet night...and He calls It "LOVE"!
