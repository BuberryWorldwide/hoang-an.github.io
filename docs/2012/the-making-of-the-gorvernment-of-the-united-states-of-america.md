The Making Of The Gorvernment Of The United States Of America


   Shortly after the Declaration of Independence, the question of should the Union still exist after the war was raised. The Continental Congress drew up the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. At first, the states did not accept it. Some feared the Central Government would not be strong enough. Others thought that they might not be able to govern their people. After some changes were made, however, the Articles were signed by the States o­n March 1, 1781. It gave the Central Government the authority to make money and make war.

   The plan was weak because it gave too little authority to the Central Govenment. Its weaknesses were:

(1) The Central Government could do nothing without the consent of the States;
(2) It had no power to enforce the requests it gave to the States: it could not force the States
     give it money or soldiers.
(3) After the war, the o­ne common purpose of gaining independence was gone. The States did
     not know o­ne another well. They quarreled over trade issues, over tax issues, and over who
     own which land. The Central Government could not regulate trade between the States and
     between the States and other countries. It made treaties with foreign nations which the
     States did not obey.
(4) The Central Government had no President and Judicial Branch. The Congress has no power
     to enforce the laws or to ask the people to support the Central Government.

     The States and the Confederation Congress knew that they must have a stronger Central Government. Alone, each state would be helpless if foreign nations attack it. It could not protect its citizens' trade o­n high seas. Nor can it defend itself against Indian's attack.

     o­n May 25th, 1787, a Convention was in session to change the Article of Confederation. 55 delegates met and decided to write a new constitution. o­n September 17, 1787 the new Constitution was signed by 36 delegates. The Constitution set up a Federal Government with three branches, Executive to enforce the laws, a Legislative Congress of two houses to make laws, and the Judicial Branch to interpret the laws.  The states each had two senators in Senate. The number of representatives in the lower House was determined by population. The Constitution gave the Central Government the authority to tax, to regulate trade, and to enforce the Constitution, Congressional laws, and treaties.

   The Congress asked the people to elect delegates to a State Constitution Convention to vote o­n ratification of the new Constitution. Delaware voted to ratify the new Constitution o­n December 7, 1787. Pennylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut ratified it next. Massachusetts voted to come into the new Union after it got the agreement of other states to make some changes in the Constitution later. Maryland, South Carolina, and New Hampshire voted yes; that make nine States which had accepted the Constitution.

   The three largest States, New York, Virginia and South Carolina had not voted yes. Rhode Island had voted not to accept. The Union would not be solid until these States join the Union. North Carolina and Virginia separated Georgia and South Carolina from Delaware and Maryland. After other States agreed that a Bill of Rights will be added to the Constitution, Virginia ratifed the Constitution. New York joined the Union o­n July 26, 1788. North Carolina and Rhode Island completed the new Union.
