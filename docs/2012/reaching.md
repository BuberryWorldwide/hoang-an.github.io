# REACHING

Hoàng-Ân


REACHING


above the clouds
is the firmament
dividing humans and angels

between you and me
endless posibilities
stretch...
we come together
then
we part

but
goodwill
and tender words
bridge
the void between

on the day
of the last breath
humans turn spirits
and will walk
with angels
and face the Infinite..!!

today,
however,
I reach across all
to touch you
and we are:

One..!!
