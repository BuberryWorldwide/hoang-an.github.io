# TRUTH SEEKERS

TRUTH SEEKERS

Misery O frightful Soul, embracing Light and Darkness, where tread the lost-to-be-found. Harken to the Music eerily the invisible Piper threads along the sometimes bleak Yellow Brick Road: homeward-bound through that uncertain vast dunes-of-windblasted wilderness of paradoxical push-and-pulls of emotions...Lone-seekers of bruised Heart--looking for the Original Face at the beginning point, entering the search for that illusive concept: Destiny! A word the sanes never seem to mention.

Fate! Inadequate, meek Soul! Can be the Blesser for future merging or separation. Declares, o­nce, Hope--by the mantra of that Salvation: (Yours!): the expressive soul through Art...the voice; the inspired Orpheus. Of violet Melody! Of starry smiles and Peace at the portal of the last Good-Bye Kiss. Illuminate feelings kaleidoscope through resplendent prisms. Wherein whether flowers of finality will bloom in whose Heart that accepts and reaches forward toward Relativity: The human awareness for limitation, wherein the rebellious spirit soar; and the soul, dying for Beauty shall together choose Whose Faith colors in mysterious Hues of Whose Eyes: the depth mercifully shut! The ultimate coalesence: Beings that cross the yonder line: Unknowable Soul to Death: not bowing but with meek humility welcomes the knowledge, or even clarity:

O, Comforted Soul...to exist is forever until the miracles awaiting happen like grass greening unto Summer; and dyes o­ne's eyes' color into Emeral Green!
...The pure tones of children laughter ring like a lullaby unto restful slumber...
