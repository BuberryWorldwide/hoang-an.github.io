# I WISH FOR SWEETNESS

I WISH FOR SWEETNESS


I am in love and I wish for sweetness...
...In the Poem I'm looking for..!!
I look for lovers' kisses
without tears, without broken lines
without lamentation, without politics..!!

I'm looking for embraces
for body heat and deep penetration
for orgasmic screams
for communication, pure and sincere
for excruciating pain meeting with heaven-high bliss
of merging too distant to look for more.

I'm wishing for tongues, hot and moist
I'm wishing for anology of mountains and marshes
of climbers and explorers
Into the darkest caves of human searching
Their bodies, my body, our Bodies..!!

I'm looking for Summer grass fragrant
in lovers' hair
I'm looking for the saltiness o­n the damp skin
of entwining young flesh o­n the sandy beaches
with the sun becoming disolved in the raging heat of the fingers..!!

I'm wishing for the fondling
of freedom for an instant of the fantasy of conquering Death
Before this awareness of the gravitational force
pulls my depressed Spirit
earthward bound again...(Ahhh...Yes: again..!!)

Please show me another Poem
Or am I too ambitious in my hungering wishing for Love-so-Pure..?!?!
