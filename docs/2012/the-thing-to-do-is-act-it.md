# THE THING TO DO IS ACT IT

THE THING TO DO IS ACT IT


The thing to do with Truth
is to believe it:
Your own..!!
The thing to do with Truth
is to be it:
There is o­nly o­nE Truth:
deep within You
It rises: be Yourself with It
and You shall recognize It..!!

The thing to do with a Feeling
is to feel it:
How else to know if It is Yours?
The thing to do with an emotion
is to let it be...It'll find release
in Your relief, is Your Relief..!!

The thing to do with Love
is to simply experience It
to the utmost:
to not love with all of Your might
should You are resisting It:
Surrender is a self-illumination
of Your deep and true intention..!!

Love is a kind of Truth
and Truth is just something
You feel deeply in the most
natural flow from Your self
when You are most comfortable
being who You are
what You are like
how You do feel:

Truth is a feeling about Love
that You have when You like
being inside the skin of Yourself!
So fit and comfortable..ahhh..!!

Resist with all of Your strength;
Wanting with all of Your desire...
Then let it go...let Yourself go:
    In the end: opposites speak
    from the same depth;
    Truth is an encompassing
    WHOLE..!!
If You must be divisive
be it totally, completely
and perfectly.
A bold act of committment
has in its the Beauty of
    a courageous spirit
    indominable self-belief
    inscrutable self-awareness
       and
    magical Freedom from o­ne Self...
that to realize all there is to
Happiness and Peace-of-Mind
is to unencumbitibly be Yourself..!!

As to all things: to live is actually
The-Act-Of-Being-Yourself
at all time: without any fears..!!
