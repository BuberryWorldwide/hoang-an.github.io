# SOUND MAKES FLESH

Hoàng-Ân


SOUND MAKES FLESH

O bells, ring
windchimes, sing
percussions, shiver...
my head can no longer contain
my tender brain,
my skull teases me
chemical, electrons
synapses and such

I need to hear soft breeze
travels
over the vast depth
of the eternal
ocean
of
love ..!!

Genesis..!!
Genesis..!!
Why Exodus..??
Why Exodus..??

Childish rhymth, childish rhyme
Childish bizzard blind faith
entering my soul:
Yet, somehow it seems to
make sense:   because of
                        The Music..!!
