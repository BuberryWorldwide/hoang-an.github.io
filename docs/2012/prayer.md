# PRAYER

PRAYER


Please rain moisture upon my desert!  The soft sands and dry tumbleweeds reaching thoroughly so into the wilderness of my soul.  What does it want when it burns my thoat in a song I do not know!  It refuses to tell me its secret!  Oh, how I pray for it to let me be its confident..!!

Please grace me with a beam of light through the single crack o­n the ceiling of my confinement.  I have thought that my Spirit can soar utterly high. What is this thick darkness that has stolen its laughters, and why does it surrender so easily to the weight of sadness and silent suffering..??

Please go o­n and make me an offering to pacify the zealous gods and jealous goddesses up o­n the mountain tops: then at least my sorrow is justified.  Like the silent dunes shift noiselessly along the movements of Fate, my sandals drag Time o­n the homeward bound:  Let the wind stir the red sandstorm of greed and resentment; I am shredding my tears as the sacred sound of Faith resounding.

Incantation and spells and charms and tallismans: I surrender to the o­ne who knows who I am, my Soul..!!
