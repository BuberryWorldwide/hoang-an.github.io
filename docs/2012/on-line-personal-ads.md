# ON LINE PERSONAL ADS

Hoàng-Ân

ON-LINE PERSONAL ADS

joy is fleeting
   sorrow deepening
       more than often:
           never satisfying...

for every three new faces
three dance-step patterns:
the familiar
   escaping the embracing;

for every smile
    ten drops of crystalized tears
       simply dripping
           mourning for the parting!

'twas never enough
the heartaches and pain
evading the issue of honesty in doubt
   the jokes backfired..!!

in silence...space and time a-waiting...for some kind of meaning to dawn and making sense out of senseless loneliness...upon the purple and orange horizon, the red peach of a sun swirling fire into darkness of silent deep space..and sleepily the hearts of lovers evade the question of trust..!!

greeting night: drowsy firelight a-dimming: achingly persuasive: to close those hungrying eyes for a merciful forgetfulness: for a presence just alone so lonely.
