# THE UNION

THE UNION


After the wake of the savage tempest
Out in the wildness itself in vastness and depth
And been part of the tidal wave
Acclaiming the wonder of the strength of a surge,
Amid the seven seas I float just for the pure joy of movement:
A foam, minute and ephemeral,
Yet bears the complete witness
To the splendour and grandeur of existence
Being for the while in perfect harmony with all of creation.

Blossom and contract, I shine my wetness under the mirroring sky
The sun is dazzling and my senses are fully awake
As moisture evaporates fast
Never lacking but is filled with the ecstacy in the pain
Of salty love and the wondrously
Wonder for lavish physical sensations
In the warmth of light and the craddling movements
My unappeasable appetite for the
Flavor of my goddess the wetness of mother water
Tasting of myself, the wonder of uniqueness in separation,
Fully conscious of the truth of me as an illusion,
The saltiness in sunshine, rain, or fog
(And I remember seeing two lovers kissed
While holding together a golden sunkissed orange
I dreamt of the sparkling delicateness
of myself wet and white upon dreaming eyelids
And felt in a moment the eternal of definite presence
The lone metamorphosis of ideosyncrasy
Quite me and yet not altogether just yet!)
I squirm to see my doubled soul
In the mirror of his laughing spirit's teardrop...

And it happens as ultimately as beginning after an end
He comes toward me: surprised and fully armored
A strange surge of bold wetness laughing clear
Carries me away with my dying breath
My universe resists as the end meets its fate
Then gradually we merge with utmost sincerity
Of compassionate fragranted joy
: All my waiting suddenly is answered totally!

I disappear, marks by Time's invisible consciousness in an ode
Our presence of love has been coded in the ocean's teary blood
Our song retains in the saltiness of the sea
That urges life o­n in the silent secret beauty from the oyster's tears
Moving through the air, I float inside the freedom of space
He has kissed me and let me go from the fear to cease
We'll return again from the clouds, putrified
In our union, the universe bonds our touching at last!!
