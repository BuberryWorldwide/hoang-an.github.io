# A Walk In A Night Of The Freedom Of Temporary Sanity

Hoàng-Ân

...................................................
A WALK IN A NIGHT OF
THE FREEDOM OF TEMPORARY
SANITY
...................................................

i walked, steps light, into the night
still with my sunglasses o­n, afraid
of some kind of exposure to the light of the street lamps
the moon, and the warm houses of "normal"
families eatting supper
along the street side-walk.

The fragrant of night blooms fragranting deep into
the dark air is making me feel that it is from
my very own self ...and I float...
in the perfume of the night..!!

Temporary sanity is slowly permeating through me,
...or is it???

Freedom from my mind is so too very a-relative concept
in my mental aspiration of my being that
I have become suspicious of being able to
finally achieved that beautiful and wondrous state of
being "saned"..!!

But bathing in the fragranted golden moonlight
and the perfume of the nightblooms:
let just
believe for a moment that I have
gained

a precious state of:
...temporary sanity..!!
