Metaphysics and Life


Vincent van Gogh did not know
that he had become a trillionaire, of sort.
Gustave Flaubert is still probably lying down
with the aim unrequitted
     , to murder the meaning of language
       to forge a failed attempt
       to connect the mind to the sense of
       the soul's actual reality.
Andre Gide and Paul Gauguin may set aside
       their differences, long enough for
       a handshake, complementing the other
       each at the will to sacrify all in order
       to show the triumph of Beauty
       over Death, and Life over
       mundane rules and rigid regulations
       as disguised social, so called, morality..!!

and down here, the professional executives
are reading the Wall Street Journal,
the stock brokers speeding up
the tapestry design of human potential
for a Masterpiece of global humane economy...

and down here, the weeping soldier weeps,
for all his heroes and heroines
whose heaven they have met...

and down here the children starve
for a home
bread
and
love, love, love...

And down here,
Only the Heart
of all the sages
the true artists
and Plato's Republic's
ostricied poets

feels..!!
