# BY THE RIVER BANK

Hoàng-Ân


BY THE RIVER BANK

the river gushing by
oozing in silt, rich and fertile
it curves along the banks
and etches its hope at the horizon;
bubbling against the land's embrace,
its coolness bathes my ankles.
His left arm around me
his head rests upon my right shoulder
the wind caressing our bodies,
a sudden hawk speared the water.
A lazy june afternoon, the sun drunkedned and eerie
reduces all puzzling issues of history being made
to a dazed half-asleep state-of-mind and
intelligence is a dreary subject
able to lure no o­ne in its wake.
