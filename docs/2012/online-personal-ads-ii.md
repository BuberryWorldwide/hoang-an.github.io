# ON-LINE PERSONAL ADS II

ON-LINE PERSONAL ADS II:
GIVE AND TAKE IN PERFECT
HARMONY

It's blessed to receive
      blessed to give
Yet, be prepared to receive
      careful in giving

For in receiving we parttake of another
and in giving we give away parts of ourselves

and for good or evil, that part can't be certain
which would bring fortune if not harmful goodwill

To give is not always generosity
and in receiving is blessing given
Be ready to stretch your imagination
when you deal with a free spirit:
As with serendipity comes lessons for merciful humaness
be certain to feel pain...be ready to forget..!!
And shall be lingering in the meaning of the drama.

Bittersweet is the poison as medication for the soaring spirits
We are both students and teachers to o­ne another:
Exchanging wisdom:
      The heart be opened wide and humble to be taught
      The mind be alerted for the revelation of our divinity.

Someone comes through our live when s/he is needed by us;
We come into the life of another as needed we:
Taking for granted the services
Treasure the sacred silk ties that
       Actually are very fragile
Take the NOW in exchange with the plans
Focus and not spread thin
On the treacherous plane of proactive impatience.

Give and take in perfect harmony
And please don't take it all
To mean forever for the PRESENT is the o­nly
        Everlasting FREEDOM:
Release the leashes tying around the excruciating pain of hidden loneliness
Set free the feelings of amazing and fantastic liberation of
The Search for a perfect fit and more: Self-knowledge,
        The torch that lights the path in
        perfect stillness of the wilderness
        when we each are
        The Loving Spiritual Sojourner
        Looking to be whole in being o­ne with a kindred soul:

"And in the end, the love that you take is equal to the love you make..!!)*
