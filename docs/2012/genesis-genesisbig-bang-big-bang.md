GENESIS, GENESIS...BIG BANG, BIG BANG


Genesis, Genesis
considering by many
as a myth, a myth

Big Bang, the Big Bang
(let us remind ourselves that)
is o­nly just
a scientific
theory, a theory

let's position the instantaneous
explosion into the universe's birth
of the Big Bang
at the core of the Genesis myth
and then envision
the solar system at the center
of the known and unknown
universe
with the sun in dead middle
so, where is the earth
in the whole of it??

oh, no:
albie all the earthly suppositions,
the assumptions and presumptions
it's the earth that is in the middle of
both the myth and the scientific theory
because it is the green planet
that holds the
experience of our Lord's Calvary
on the Skull hill
on the Skull hill
where a God was cruxified
for us, for us

theories are scientific conceptions of man's mind
myths are the spiritual attempts to explain existence
and both are feeble and not constant truth:
yet, it's miraculous that man's mind
can conceptualize boundlessness,
but cannot describe endlessness...
for as with God's marking off where
the waves ending at the shore line,
God harnesses man's arrogance
at the horizon of human's senses

we all want to go to heaven
but none of us is willing to die
(it's is o­nly human to be just so)
Jesus-the-Christ bore his cross
on his believers' and unbelievers' trail
suffered and died, forgiving his murderers
he died a horrible death to prove his love
he resurrected so we can have hope

his death was painful
his suffering was intolerable--but
his resurrection was victorious: and so
his birth rings still comfort and joy

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
to all the most incurable romantics
to all the most indiscernable dreamers
of whom our Lord-of-Calvary blessed:
"Blessed are those who do not see but believe!"

Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
to both:
the Big Bang theorists
and Genesis myth weavers:

"Glory be to God o­n high,
  Peace o­n earth and goodwill towards mankind."
