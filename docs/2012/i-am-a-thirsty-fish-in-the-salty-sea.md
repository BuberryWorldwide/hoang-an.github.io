# I Am A Thirsty Fish In The Salty Sea

Hoàng-Ân

I Am A Thirsty Fish In The Salty Sea


I'm a thirsty fish weeping in the seven seas
longing for someone to come and take me to some gentle lagoon
swimming alone among the green from seaweeds
I drink in the sea water
the salts seep deep into my body
but the longing is deeper than the saltiness.

I'm a thirsty fish weeping in the seven seas
yearning for another to sing with me
at night I swim to the surface
looking at the gently smiling stars
the starry nights
are kind and not
Wish that your love would be
a gentle net that shall catch my soul.

Wish that you will come and spread that starry net
And your vast soul shall cradle my thirst
and the seas shall blue the deepest blue.
