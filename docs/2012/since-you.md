# Since YOU..!!

Hoàng-Ân

!!..SINCE YOU..!!


He said he loved me,
and gave his roses to bluer eyes.
He's made me promises,
and danced with another at the ball all night!

Since you came, you gave me a violet,
Since you came, you've never flirted:
Yet, you gave me all your kind smiles,
Yet, you held me whenever I cried!

You never tell me of your love,
But when you look into my eyes,
I hear a thousand wings fluttering,
and the stars speak for you in
laughters that are warm of forever-mores...

Come without promises, you'll make not a vow!

But since you come I believe in miracles
And I no longer need to dream
For I live within your embrace
And enchanted within your warmth
Your gentle voice singing me to sleep,
Your soft caresses upon my brows stainted gold!

Ever since you
entered my life
Life is sweeter than the usual bitter-sweetness
Ever since you
stayed in my world
Love is full of promises in itself

True love is caring for me, from YOU..!!
True love, to me, Is Caring,
to me, to me..!!

Empty words and vain promises:
Not for me, not for me..!!
