# SEA SEES EYES

SEA SEES EYES


Seashells o­n the shore
Dried up starfish
Medicinal seahorses in glass jars
of Chinese clinics
Whale fat and sharkfins
Ahhh...seashells o­n the shore ...

The songs from deep blue ocean
In the empty space inside seashells
Singing the siren tunes that lure the imagination
Inspire the longing for distant lands
Some can hear the calls
Others o­nly put them as
Vacations' souvenirs o­n the livingroom shelves
Ohhh...seashells o­n the shore
Ahhh...seashells o­n the shelves...
