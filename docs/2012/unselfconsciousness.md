# Un-Self-Consciousness

Hoàng-Ân


Un-Self-Consciousness



She leads me to the sea
the paths covered with red and orange poppies
from memories of distant past ...
Her legs, long, stride so majestically
So oftenly she turns her head around to check upon my
presence,
laughing and kissing the winter air so very
tenderly
Fingernails painted marinetime blue
Fragrant of salts and seaweeds
cling to her red coat and translucent skin
Where are the jelly fish, she's often wondered
and the seahorse dried in the street vendors' baskets??

Along our walk along-side the beer-bubbling waves
She is freedom reincarnating
As liberated and wild as her maddening
hair that floats in the calling wind
While I dream of the wild horses
when I look deep into her eyes.
