RELATIONSHIP

     O­ne day, a Zen Master told o­ne of his disciples,

--Go out and find me anything that is not a drug.
 
     His disciple looked everywhere but could not find o­ne. He came back and said,

--Nothing is not a drug.

     The Zen Master said,

--Whatever is a drug, you bring it back here.

     The disciple brought them back and gave them to his master. The Zen Master showed to everyone there and said,

--These drugs can kill and can cure.

     We all looking and yearning for relationships, for love. But if all these seekers of love were to be put in the same room, they will seat in their shells crying for relationships and yet cannot meet. Why is that? Is it because all are searching for the same thing but because of their differences they become blinded to their common goal?!
    
     Love is disguised under many forms. It is like a drug that can kill as well as cure. Why do people sitting still, their heart bleeding from pain and hidden loneliness and proud aloneness, their minds numbing under the yearning for relationships. And yet, they cannot tear off their masks and join o­ne another in a dance of love and joy?

     Kahlil Gibran wrote in his book, "Jesus The Son Of Man", "No man or woman committed any sin, but all people committed all sins." We love ourselves but that is not enough for any of us. We need to love and be loved by others, too. And when that cannot be done, we are doomed in utter sorrow.

     Let love be a drug that cures not kills.
