# Renewing Hope

RENEWING HOPE


Don't lead the Music
Just let the Music guide you
You will see the tender grass and purple daisies
Dotting the verdant vista
You will feel the lustful leaves bound thirsty Summer
You will be colored by the golden and maroon hues
Dipping by Autumn's dawns and dusks
And Winter snows and icycles
Will leave you a sensibility of Life's patience
      as the God of the seasons
      silently mystifying our
Oneness
into another Spring.

And Winter snows and icycles
Will leave you a sensibility of Life's patience
      as the God of the seasons
      silently mystifying our
