# WINTER PREPARATION

Hoàng-Ân


WINTER PREPARATION
......................................................................
(for NguoiChet of Nhạc Death)
......................................................................


Golden threads, red gossamer
Dragons, birds of paradise and
Black mums of chrysanthemums
Aching green ferns and weeping willows
Yellow bamboos with pandas clinging among
the patient eucalypt branches:
The cloth I weaved to sew thee thy coat.

    winter is coming
    o­n the dripping clouds
    blurring the horizon between
    secret worlds.

    i am waiting with equanimity
    such is your image in me..!!
    respect is delicate and hard
    to understand in the integrity
    of the performance.

Sweet violets paint the fields
Lavender blooms bleed innocently into the seasons
Deep wisdom of purple sunset clouds
Into a loom I feed my empathy and love
of ancient colors and court designs
For a coat for you to
keep You warm
When outside the north wind laid waste the garden.
