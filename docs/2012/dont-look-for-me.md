# Don't Look For Me

.......................................................................................................
Don't Look For Me

.........................Hoàng-Ân..............................................................


Don't stop yet, my Darling!  The journey hasn't even started.
Where are the burning pebbles You've lent me to remind me of
the obstacles ahead??

I can see your neck Like that of a ram
I can see your throat Marked by Adam's straying
I can hear your heart beating calculatingly
Anticipating a march
The drum beats within your chest
Cadently counting

Don't stop now, my Love!
Finish your contest
The elite is waiting
For you to prove that they are right
That it takes a strong bull
To be their champion
In the race of the victorious race!

Don't look at the sideline  Of the freak parade
I'm o­nly the joker  In their deck of cards
And you are their king of heart
with the queens and princesses o­n queue
To crown you all over again
To feed you sweet grapes

Don't look at the sideline:
I won't be there..!!
