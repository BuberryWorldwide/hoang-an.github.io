# The Prize Of That First and Last Breath

Hoàng-Ân


.........................................
THE PRIZE OF THAT
FIRST AND LAST BREATH
..........................................


Burn! Burn! Burn!
The dark soul with the fireball of knowledge.

Rage! Rage! Rage!
Against ignorance and the chance of changing into a set mind.

Rise! Rise! Rise!
Against the absolute structure of expectation
To sooth the common pain of the rejected.

Love! Love! Love!
That last breath into the vindication
for the meaning of a fulfilled state
in that giving of the last exhale.
