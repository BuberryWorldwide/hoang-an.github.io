# Love Me For Awhile

LOVE ME FOR AWHILE
......................................................................

Intoxicate me with your amorous poison
Asphyxiate me, with your deadly mind
My body feels like it's a prison:
Will you love me, if it's just for awhile?
Now I may not be the world's greatest lover
And I may not wear all the latest in styles
But I've been burned more than o­nce
Could you love me, if it's just for awhile?
Only for awhile
Because nothing else will matter
Everybody says you're a real heart-breaker
But nobody minds if you choose to beguile:
My madness will go o­n forever
'Till you love me
(even if it's just for awhile).
