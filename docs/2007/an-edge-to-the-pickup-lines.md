# An Edge to The "Pickup Lines"

An Edge to The "Pickup Lines"

--Hi! How are you?
-Hi...I'm great, and how are you?
--Couldn't be better, thanks! It's a beautiful day, huh?
-Yes! Perfect weather for almost mid winter! Is that why you're seating o­n the sidewalk?
--Nay...Is that a real question or just a conversational gesture?
-Well...I'm not sure...I guess you can take it both way...I guess...
--Be it then...Actually I'm sitting here waiting for my rocket...(smile)
-Ah...strange: how big is the rocket?  It seems to be a small landing ground here.
--Nay: mine is a o­ne-size fits all kinda rocket.  I think you'll like it, it's painted violet...kinda like a Ferrare of automobiles...very exotic!  o­nly thing is that I haven't repainted it yet...ha ha...
-Well, my style is more like an old classic Chevy pickup!
--May I have your number?...Please??
-Not really...well, here comes my bus!  Nice talking to you!
--Same here: have a pleasant day, huh!
-Thanks...you too!
