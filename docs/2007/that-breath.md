# THAT BREATH

THAT BREATH
Burn! Burn! Burn!
The darkness of the soul with the fireball of knowledge.
Rage! Rage! Rage!
Against the ignorance of the tendency to change into a set mind.
Rise! Rise! Rise!
Above the urge to chain the spirit with dogmas for the sake of order.
Love! Love! Love!
Into That Breath...
As to vindicate the meaning of thoughts, feelings, and deeds
In the last exhale.

THAT BREATH
Burn! Burn! Burn!
The darkness of the soul with the fireball of knowledge.
Rage! Rage! Rage!
Against the ignorance of the tendency to change into a set mind.
Rise! Rise! Rise!
Above the urge to chain the spirit with dogmas for the sake of order.
Love! Love! Love!
Into That Breath...
As to vindicate the meaning of thoughts, feelings, and deeds
In the last exhale.
