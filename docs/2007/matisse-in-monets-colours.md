# Matisse In Monet's Colours

Matisse In Monet's Colours
Running like deer on the hills of milk
Throbbing pulses yield suspension and
     timid yet alertful excitement in extreme
     bashfulness with lethal strikes against
     shyness, in a game of childish hide-and-seek...
Geraniums blooming red dots from afar, upon the
     window sills of the city houses
     down deep in the valley, protected by the trees...
...Dying up here, with you, is like achieving
     Heaven!
