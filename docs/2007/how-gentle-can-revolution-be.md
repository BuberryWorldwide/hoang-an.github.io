# How Gentle Can Revolution Be?

How Gentle Can Revolution Be?
     Are we not all fallible...to ourselves and then to each other?  How rare it is to just concentrate upon the meaning of "good intention" in our relationships: it is human nature to form opinions and passing some kind of judgment, even if just the lamentation of "you're judging me base on your own expectation for me."  And therefore it can be so hard sometimes to not take things such as advise and criticism a little bit les personally.  The paradox of the human race is that though we adhere to our individualism, we DO care about what people think of our viewpoint and how they act toward us.  Once, I have shared with my friends when they were arguing about the gender power struggle that: "Maybe the principle is love and in true love there is no power struggle!"  I still think the same!  To watch National Geographic nature films such as on earthquakes, volcano eruptions, avalanches, hurricanes, tornadoes while blasting away NILE Death Metal CDs like "Annihilation Of The Wicked" or "In Their Darkened Shrines" is to understood the obvious fact of human emotional storms: and realize so deeply the fact that we are each a god/goddess to each other in our interrelation because of powerful emotional tension from conflicting expectations.  And as lovers of life, who beautify the universe, do often times being inspired by such a natural tendency to try to impart and express love as a remedy to the misunderstanding of such expressions:  And so as revolutions bring destruction in wars, lovers bring love as the most gentle and sweet and simple force of revolutionizing the divisive force of taking a stand.  Lovers believe not in building pedestals for living heroes nor the raising up monuments in stone for the martyrs.  And should sweet blood be the retainer of life: mankind should treasure it and prevent it from being shed for illusive abstract ideals and principles.  Yes, to lovers the principle is love itself!
