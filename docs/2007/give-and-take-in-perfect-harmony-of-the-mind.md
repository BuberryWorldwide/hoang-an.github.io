# Give and Take in Perfect Harmony of The Mind

GIVE AND TAKE IN PERFECT HARMONY OF THE MIND

it's blessed to receive
     blessed to give
yet, be prepared to receive
     careful in giving
for in receiving we parttake of another
and in giving we give away parts of ourselves
for good or evil, that part can't be certain
of which will bring fortune if not harmful goodwill
to give does not always means generosity
and in receiving is blessing given
be ready to stretch your imagination
when you deal with a free spirit
as with serendipity comes lessons for the soul
be certain to feel pains
be ready to forget
all shall be lingering in the meaning of the drama
bittersweet is poison a medication for the soaring spirit
we are students and teachers
exchanging wisdom
the heart be opened wide
the mind be alerted for divinity
someone comes through our lives when s/he is needed
we come into another's life as needed us
taking for granted the services
treasuring the sacred silky ties that are easily loosened
take the now in exchange with the plans
focus and not spread thin
on the treacherous plane of proactivity
give and take in perfect harmony and
    please don't take it all
to mean forever for the present is the o­nly
everlasting freedom
release the leashes that tied around loneliness
and set free the feelings of amazingly fantastic liberation
from set mind.
