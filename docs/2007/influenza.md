        I can feel, I can tell
        I can feel, I can tell, I can see
        Something is changing
        To me change is no stranger
        I don't run, I don't hide
        I don't run, I don't hide, I don't fight
        What fate arranges
        I don't think about danger
        If it was meant for me
        I'd know just where to go
        But if I can take it slow
        Then I might be in control
        In the back of my head
        In the back of my head there is doubt
        There is suspicion
        With my new fascination
        I don't know what it is
        I don't know what it is, you might say
        It's intuition
        It's a true indication
        I should trust myself
        I should be aware of this
        But it's like a stranger's kiss
        And somehow I can't resist
        I can feel my will slip away
        From a strange influenza
        I can feel my mind slip away
        Under your influenza
        I can feel my heart slip away

        There's a part of my heart
        There's a part of my heart that cries out
        Please don't go no further
        I just can't take the pressure
        So I try to resist
        So I try to resist and my heart
        Tells me don't bother
        That this pain is a pleasure
        If I was someone else
        I wouldn't disagree
        But it's always hard to see
        When something's controlling me

         I'm under your influenza
