# My Adonis

My Adonis

Shadows dance, the crimson fire sings...Candle light, the romancing of the night.  From the open window, the breeze weaves a composition, the fluttering leaves and the crickets, a symphony is harkening.
Thy beauty, unto my eyes so resplendent, etching in darkness thy image conjured up by my mind through my heart...through the sound of thy voice: Oh, gladened music gains form...leaves my body mourning so forlorn: wanting you, a touch and a kiss; comforting words, ahhh, the divine notes.
Adonis*, whose beauty's a myth: has thus from ancient time till now moved the artists' wit: in competition to fortify his grace; yet, thy beauty is truth to my eyes, and the sudden inspiration for my lost love a-re-kindled.  Yes, truly, Adonis is thee: If I should be lacking in talent, love's genius lends me my psalms and hymns: such sweet words enchanted by thy Name: charmed deeply by thy hazy brown, brown eyes...like the firery flame of the stars in deep night and the velvety dream of the open sky: Oh, my beloved, my love for thee shall I have to hide?
The night is mercifully long as a harbinger of my dreams...the starlit canopy of the dome of breath is dimmer than the longing for recognition.  Like from light years the strange comets gone sweeping: imitating them, the deathly tasks the moths are daring unto the candle fire a-raging...And as I am watching, kindredship I am a-burning: Unrequitted love is the Heart's wishful death a-mourning.
