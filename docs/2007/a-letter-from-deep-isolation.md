# A Letter From Deep Isolation

A LETTER FROM DEEP ISOLATION

...so calm, so quiet, so awake: such peaceful now to here:
Time's easing by, economically, so thriftly, and oh i taste its
marking: so much thoughts, ebbing and waning
they are constantly coalesing, gelling, manifesting
into forms that i can almost touch with the skin o­n the palms of my hands...
they help to describe and explain and determine the existence of
the Word make flesh.
...so light, so refreshing, so wholesome
the body encompassing the flesh
and the flesh embracing the organs and bones
granting the vehicle for the mind to forget the body
while it invents, renovates, imagines, fabricates, and dreams:
but all would be futile without the body to give meaning to the invisible inner world.
Invisibility takes o­n shape
feeling out the certainty of existence
The earth still turns within the natural laws of the universe
...so patient and still
...so grand yet so humble in her silent insistence
That globe swirls o­n
while the creatures o­n her skin and firery core
struggling because of man-made
poverty in the bodies and spirits
violence rises and falls like Trigonometry curves
The push-and-pull of blind greed in the law that power always corrupts!
...We are the multitude, the gentle spiritual warriors
...We shall overcome as we serve to raise the masses' consciousness
The Universal Ideal of the humnanists forever torching for
Truth's sake!
...Do not weep alone in inner darkness
for it is darkness that helps to intensify and makes meaningful
the flame of our sojourning torches
and helps forging our need for communual warmth!
Let us reach out...the living water salting in our blood, sweat, tears
inside the haven of our corporeal substance
is
fresh and true
and
crystally cleansed
by the heat of
our hearts!
