# Another Chance

Another Chance

Like the dancers at the final rehearsal
Hers and His merge together
"I stand before you and experience a deja vous..."

"I love you! never like this before!"
The old man says sensing his invisible tears
wetting his sweet, sweet smile:
"Let's start over and introduce ourselves!"
"My name is Yours and Your Name is mine
I am from No-Where but You are my Some-where
I don't know what to do nor how to feel
I don't know what to say o­nly that 'I am in love with you!'
It has been strange how you occupy my mind
It has been painful knowing that you are denying me!"
"What would you say if I ask for your Yours?
What would you do if I should whisper through your streaming hair
making them even more soft and dreamy with my passionate breath?"
"This is how I view your epiphany about us,
That I want it to be true and real
with you and I blending together
in our realm of Indifferentiable Presence in the Absolute!"
"This is what I am trying to convey within my knowledge of you,
That for a start, let's imagine how we should converse:
'Hi, Sir! How do you do?'
'I am Desire and am desiring you!'"

"I need you to tell me a 'Yes!'
and a Want, a Hunger, and a Touch
and a Kiss, a soft but intense Caress down there where it's warm!
and an Immergence, oh!
Oh...my Love, my Life!"
"An unendable poem till we should meet again, I want you,
but you are o­nly looking 'round and not just at me
So I shall end this poem
by stabbing a thorn into my-wholly-Yours heart!
Let me weep as I bleed,
'How are you feeling?
Great?!'"
