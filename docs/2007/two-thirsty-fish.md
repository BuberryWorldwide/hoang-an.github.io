# Two Thirsty Fish

Two Thirsty Fish
You and I
are two fish in two bowls
Can we break through
the illusion of the world
outside
our hemmed in small
jarred water,
And hear the calling
of the salty sea
in the eggs that
we were?
How deep must we
dream
to remember
the boundless seas
that gives birth
to our kind?

Oh, we are
two fish
in
two bowls
sleeping
in a space
of the walking boys and girls
who think
so surely that they are
our owners
that feed us processed powders
Can we wake up
and should we?
Because if we do
Can we stand
the helmed in space
of our jarred water
With the epiphany
of an illusory
OCEAN
in our daydream?
can we remember
all our primodial dreams
while we
sleep with our 
eyes open??
