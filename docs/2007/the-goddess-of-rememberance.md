# The Goddess of Rememberance

The Goddess of Rememberance
     the dreams
     each one burns
and they burn, burn, burn
like a furnace in the
steel-mill of the soul.
     but the gods
they are sympathetic for
they too have been through the
sacrificial flames of irrationarity
so they hide my consciousness
from the goddess of Rememberance
     and the Lord of Grief
mercifully turns off all my senses
gracing my body with total rest
for throughout the waking world of daylight
can only recall the last dream
lingers in the twilight between
the inner and outer worlds.
like the soldiers utterly cautious in
metering out their corporeal potential energy
to save their alertness in vicious combats,
the body wakes afore society
stakes its claim once more
for the concrete illusion of the senses.
