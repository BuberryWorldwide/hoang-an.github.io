# Sweet Sojourners In The Realm Of Love (2)

Sweet Sojourners In The Realm Of Love (2)
     Hoài Phương, Dearest,
     Who would have the true courage to look pain in the eye and finally to dare feel to the utmost the demonic power of hidden pain?? Who dare to share the darkest moment wide awake with all the honesty of one who truly wish for the answer??  Most profess to want answers but most also avoid the real answers should they not complying to those they really want!  All parrot "and the truth shall set you free," yet freedom entails self-responsibility: if one does not have the daring courage to face The Answer, I guess she has no wish for true freedom but has always been secretly needing some base of strength outside of herself??
     I wish truly to have some pillars of strength to support my weary being in my weakest moments: and what is wrong in that?? Even the strongest wings get tired and the strongest feet get wearied and the strongest sails need a calm bay for sturdy solid land for grounding:  Yet, it is the fate of all beings to sail out into the unpredictable ocean of the rite-of-passage.  Until death overcomes and the soul enters into a different new world for new purposes, it is either to move forward into growth, creativity and expansion; or to regress!
     I guess, like Jacob, we all continuously wrestle with our spirit through the long dark night of tumultous soulsearching of supressed sobs and repressed salty tears...but also: when dawn comes and the spirit sleeps, the bright light of day which signifies self-illumination would always come: it is our choice to choose to open wide our morning eyes and take in the light of Truth which is the vast space that Freedom grants for us to Truly Take Flight: that means we have also accepted the Self-Responsibility to be the Source of Strenght, the Ground for our own Grounding!
     But, we need the Promise of embracing love and accepting heart from the others: Can we discern and make the correct choice of whose hearts to hear the calling of love??  Is the ear of our very own heart wise enough to hear the right beatings that wish for us to heed the callings??
