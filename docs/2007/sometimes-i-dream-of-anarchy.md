# Sometimes I Dream Of Anarchy

Sometimes I Dream Of Anarchy
The implimentation of your reaction, I am afraid is usually very subjective.  Your air of over-confidence in your point-of-view seems to contain much conflict and your wish for the result that befitting your own conclusion oftentimes shows a mind that is set!  All we can claim to our thoughts and ideas is actually only our personal opinion; and our perception is like that of the parable blind men describing the elephants in mankind's living room that reflect both our world as a circus and our inner mind as a dense jungle.
The inkspots of ancient beliefs that pretense to be truths: like Jesus proclaimed, "Let the deads bury the deads, follow me and have everlasting life!"  I do not as much crave for an eternal existence, only would like to be able at least to agree with the claims of my contemporaries in their determination to advocate the deads' claim to truth!
It is not a matter of "us versus them."  It is the discernment between Truth-with-a-capital-T and the pieces of puzzle in individual human beings' truth-with-a-small-case-t.  I admit I have not a stand to protect; I admit that I have nothing to convince or attract you with my own personal confusion afore The Mystery: except my baffling reverence.
Only: your truth prevents not the indifferent powerful hurricanes!  Only: your faith determines not where exactly a tornado will wreak havoc!  You and I are mere bugs caught in the overwhelming forces of nature: our likeness only proves to me that you are just as vulnerable and full of limitations!
And so...I only know one thing:  Can you prove your point without joining in with the attitudes that cause wars??
