# Queen Of Heart, Golden Moon Child

Queen Of Heart, Golden Moon Child
Queen of Heart, golden moon child
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
Enfold me within the embrace of your gentle voice
Sing your song: soft and low
Draw me into the magic of the night.
Queen of Heart, golden moon child
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
The night is deep, the stars are few
Loneliness is vast, loneliness is strong
Enfold me within the embrace of your gentle voice.
Sing! Golden moon child: magical and full of fairy tales
The dawn is far and my soul is uncontainable
Touch me deep, touch me slow
Queen of Heart, golden moon child
Soft of breasts, kind of arms
The night is deep, the stars are few
Loneliness is vast, loneliness is strong
Sing your songs, soft and low
Draw me into the magic of the night
Hold me tight, love me true
I can see you in my tossing dreams
Hold me tight, love me stronger than loneliness
Enfold me in your generous caring
I need you tonight
Draw me into the magic of your might
Oh, queen of heart, golden moon child
Soft of breasts, kind of arms...
With the voice that wakes the aches
Of the firery stars that burn themselves in
The depth of the universe full of unquenchable desires.
