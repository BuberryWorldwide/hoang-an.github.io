# Impotency

Impotency
The river, thick as chocolate
oozing with silt, flowing by
caressing your thigns
I can see the mystery
Oh! the lute of Apollo
The Piper with kaleidoscope eyes
Drawing me on
Onto the dark cities
of forgotten angels.
Once the forest was home
Now the bulldosers invade
And the birds have flown,
the does and dawn's fairies
All've eloped
The grass no longer green
The night blooms wither
Calling your names of Name
The river has long gone
And with it your sensous thigns
cooling in the gentle currents.
