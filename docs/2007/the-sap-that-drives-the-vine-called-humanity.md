# The Sap That Drives The Vine Called Humanity

The Sap That Drives The Vine Called Humanity
My Dearest Ones, the only Daughter and Son of mine,
     It is wondrously wonderful that I have succeeded in forging in our relationship the miraculous open communication feel of us as friends.  At twenty and eighteen, you have become the idealists, more bold and sincere in your outspoken lingo on the social issues of mankind, past and present, than I ever have.  It is my blessing that you respect your minds and have as your chief concern the safe-guarding of your sensibility upon the matters of protecting your integrity, concerning your moral committment.  You are like the sailboats or the ones who negotiate your kites of ideals into the adventuous winds of change.  All my effort in planting the seeds of self-respect into you have harvested in you not only of self-love but also the humanistic compassion for your fellow organisms.  With our shared love for the existing forms of life in this endlessly mysterious universe, I shall state my statement of more than just the support for your magical journey but also of gladful greeting to you as a fellow sojourner.
     I understand that you do tolerate your elders' effort at rising above the state of just merely surviving but also to thrive socially in considering the hard life they have had;  yet, you are both weary and wary at their will to raise their posterities ever higher in the social ladder of the materialistic realm.  And it is for me to rejoice and grateful that you are instead joining the rank of the humanistic thinkers with the hearts of gold in the intelligent march toward true progress: the mental evolution of true equality in natural politics, which Lao Tzu is one of its humble advocate.  You do not accept blindly the set up of  institutionalism with superficial governmental propaganda, which leads to a system of artifical values in mass production of identicality, i. e., mass media advertisement of automobiles, refrigerators, cosmetics, so ready-made that the most important choice the consumers need make is the choice of their favorite colors;  and fastfood franchises in proud acclaims of exact design of millions served of identical weight and preparing procedures as in McDonald hamburgers and french fries all over the free world.
     In the chapter "On Children" of  his book THE PROPHET, Kahlil Gibran has written that "Your children are not your children but the children of life," and that the world of their minds belongs to a future that their parents cannot even dream of.  That is unless they are willing to step aside and try to grasp the expressions of their posterities' brave, new world of fresh beliefs in totally new possibilities.
     It is exciting for me because after temporarily halting my own "search" for twenty years to concentrate on preparing you for your own search,  I am now also moving forward with you.  For years of conscientiously promoting the oppotunities for you to take ownership of your own minds with the training in being self-reliant and independent-minded, I am now joining you in the same journey toward self-knowledge and self-actualization.  I am one of those blessed parents who can share with their children the spirit of camaraderie in the process of adding cornerstones to a brave new world everly attainable beyond the everly extending horizon of progress.  Ones who see clearly the negativities in the establishment of arbitrary and ambiguous "moral" social contracts full of supeficial values and hypocritical "-isms" that allow such concept as "wars in the name of peace" to be taken at face value.
     I am elated to join with my children as among the gentle spiritual warriors, to be in-step with you in the belief for the newness of pure courage and fresh confidence: to be able to believe that in simply making a difference in ourselves we renew our world with our true love for true freedom.  We are truly the sap to force on true progress in the understanding of what it is to be worthy of being human, the inheritors of life that worths living for.  Instead of all the artificial torches that are being kept burning in some political institutional memorial malls with statues for warring heroes, we are the sap that as in Dylan Thomas' "The force of the green fuse that drives the flower" that feed our love into the living mystery called life.  Ardent in our heeding to the calling of the sacredness of the life force, we are being joined together in our passion to protect, sustain, and prolong this miraculous mystery of creation so graciously granting to us.  I am proud to be both your mother and a fellow traveler who has much to learn from your fresh youthful courage and strength of the lovers of peace.  I celebrate myself and I celebrate you with utmost pride in our rare camaraderie!
