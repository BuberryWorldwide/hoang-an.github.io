# Mid-Morning Blues

Mid-Morning Blues
The kitchen needs cleaning
The bathroom is too
The sourdough loaf of bread is in the refrigerator
The butter is in the freezer
The toaster has shortcircuited
Credit card from Foodstamp pride
All the bills are paid
...How come I am so blue?
The day's short, the day's long
The medicines sitting in a row in the cabinet
One to cure the side-effects of the other
Multiplying and there they sit.
The wrinkled old grandma
Seating in the chair on the other side of
    the desk stressing the position of
    authority as a counselor,
Repeating the stereotype: "It is only
the disposition of your race!"

No wonder I am so blue!
No wonder I am so blue!
Oh, the medicine cabinet,
the wardrope for my brain...
A cigarette!  I need
a cigarette...
My friends say: "We are
attempting suicide with smoking!"
And grins...
No matter: I need a cigarette,
"Give me my cigarette!"
