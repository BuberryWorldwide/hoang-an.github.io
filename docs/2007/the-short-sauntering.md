# The Short Sauntering

The Short Sauntering
The little girl with a pony tail
a blue ribbon ties around her jet black
crown.
She is jumping, she is singing
a riddle that makes no sense.
She is dancing,
She is stopping:
The tunes dissipate and stumble
on a pebble.
She picks it up and takes off her left shoe
She puts it inside it.
She balances herself away
on the leafy lane
with her right shoe in her left hand.
One shoe is red the other green
Where is her purple one?
And what is the color of the

     pebble that now
     is
     hers?
     hers?
