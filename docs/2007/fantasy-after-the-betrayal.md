# Fantasy After The Betrayal

Fantasy After The Betrayal

     Running barefeet down the hill against the wind...eyes biting, hair floating into the tangling, backward along the air current...dressing impeculately white with pink laces.
...low in the valley is the fast rapid
water beating itself against the boulders of rock
foams, bubbles, silvery mercury white
disappearing then reappearing: roaring across space and time...
...murmuring stories of adventures and misadventures;
none without some degree of regret
...rushing...rushing...rushing...
: her body floats
bloody white poccadotted...flowing
yieldingly, passionately sweet to the rough rapid
heading hurrily toward
the edge of the waterfall...

...The trees sway, the water sings
Mother Nature whispers her call and tells the story of unrequitted love!
