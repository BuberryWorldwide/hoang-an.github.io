# Gentle Knight

Gentle Knight
Across the room, I caught your gaze
I saw the brightness in your eyes and I was amazed
As if dragons were being slayed
and the hero was making his day in
making his way toward the castle through
jungles, through the mazes!
Bodies between us are swaying
I can't help but feel the heat and
your movements harmonizing with the beats
I am shaking and I feel like fleeing
I can feel the vibrations
vibrate from your body into the hazy air
like a snake twistingly sliding through
Your head holds high and proud
A sensuous smirk lurking around your mouth
I feel dizzy and so very drunkened
My whole melts as my knees turn weak
Then your arms catch me in an embrace
As you and I are dancing with our eyes
Wet with a conspiratory glance deep
I shut them as your lips breathe mint breath
like a soft muscle gliding smooth and dangerous
Farewell Freedom, what love doesn't offend
and enslave the body:
I am already wanting to be its captive.
