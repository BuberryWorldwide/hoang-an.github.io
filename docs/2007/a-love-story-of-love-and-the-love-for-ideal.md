# A Love Story Of Love And The Love For Ideal

HOÀNG-ÂN.....................................................

A Love Story Of Love And The Love For Idea
......................................................................l

     The paths are steep and slippery...The branches above are wet with rain...The leaves are achingly green...And lavender blooms, honey suckles, aroma so sweet it can make o­ne dizzy.
     I follow the smoothly worn trail that is covered with pine needles, a blanket thick of rich brown hues...toward your patio, a brandy awaiting...like you are waiting: of ivory skin and body warm of lust for me...I am shaking, not from the cold but with the anticipation like a male beast in heat that has just sensed out the odor of his female.
     There is doubt; there is ambivalence: in me...Am I in love?
     No, I am too free and idealistic!
     I must have a cause to serve...beside being a rake!
     But as I draw near the high fence of your
     husband's house
     I am in a daze:  My body knows you much more so
     than my heart does.
     So sorry, I do love you in my own way...the o­nly way I know:  Your silohuette curves against the upstairs window pane; graceful and womanly...Soon, soon, my Darling...you will be in my arms...And then, let wars and revolutions come and go for a moment...While it lasts let the clouds of histories in the making churn in gulves...The thunders roar...as the force of Mother Nature rents our primordal urges to release her hunger for her longing for the sheer movements in the soft vulnerable world of visibility in mankind's flesh, bones, and blood that know pain beyond endurance.
 
**(This short prose retells the story of Virginia Woofe's sister's o­nly son, Adrian (last name forgotten).  He was an English professor in Hong Kong during World War II.  He had an affair with his Chinese colleague's wife.  She staged a meeting with Adrian at her home where her husband found out about their affair to force Adrian to choose to go public with her.  Adrian declined and instead volunteered to drive a Red Cross ambulence in Africa, where he was killed in a Nazis bomb raid.  When his body was discovered, it was found clutching in his hand a handkerchief  that his Chinese lover had embroided with his name and hers entwined.)
