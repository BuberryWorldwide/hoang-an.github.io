# Non-Causal Feud

Non-Causal Feud
Dreamily dreamy ground,
not a blade of grass
for early summer,
Only smooth skin, pinkish brown of
naked tamed earth.
A few half-yellowed leaves
frolicking in the
chiming breeze.
The dark, rich, lustrious canopy above
rings the murmuring of Life.
Exotic tropical fruits dangle on strong stems
Still thick with pungently bitter sạp
The scent of a million kinds of herb
and resplendent blossoms' perfume
soaking deep into the substance
and the essence of the multitudes...
Floating along the currents of the winding wind
I enmesh my grief in a gould of feverish heat
I long to
let go of myself
completely!
"Why not!?" -- the yearning part in me is asking;
There, uncontrollably, rises in me the penchant to
eternally resisting the chances of Fate;
I often run toward the safe
embraces of my rooms
in The Castle.
To find refuge from the unpredictable cruel hand
of Nature.
Life to me is securably pressed
between the pages, between
the packaged endings of adventures
and especially of misadventures.
I have often cheated against myself by
flipping, trembling with anticipation,
toward the last pages first.
Today!  My
Mother has passed away!
    and as she is traveling
    beyond the threshold
    of the one single breath
I am also for the first time
    venturing afar out of
    The Castle's familiar, secured
    curtains drawn rooms.
The sun glazes furiously
but only as a good-natured jest
For it is still late spring and the
verdant leaves enclave the
exotic color scheme of the flowers in
the deft hand of Nature's fan.
I spotted a chameleon
stepping gingerly across the distance
between the bushes and earth--
Its color swells and swirles magically.
I tremble and shudder
: Magic is definitely outside here, too,
just as in the bounded books
Only, here, everything is aggressively striking and raw
stabbing straight into the pores and senses!
"...in...out...in...out..."
    I breathe
    and feel my private swells...
There is a violent rush vibrates
    from deep within me--
That place where light and darkness meet--
hides and feeds my
potential
to have both
the holy and beastly
sensations!
I suddenly want to strike at
     the face
of a...........man
--Not, no, not
a thing, an animal, and certainly not
a person of my opposite sex
     It has to be
     the face
     ...of a man:
May be that of
my Father..!!
