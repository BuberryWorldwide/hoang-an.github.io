# Summer Touch

Summer Touch

flickering fireflies
seeking affection from the stars so far above
light of the moon
light reflecting from tender dreams
in the twilight of hope against hope
reminiscence of the first kiss
not yet taking place
with a phantom for a lover

...yet the lips
seem to know
the stranger's lips
in the summer night...
forever meditating
the dreaming lips
gently imagine
that kiss
and the scent of
intimate sweat
summer heat at night
touches
the kiss with a deep touch
of sensuous envisioning
the forbidden fruit
being tended by love
awaiting lustful
teeth and tongues
...summer night
welcomes arms to hold
and mouth to know
the knowledge of closeness...
