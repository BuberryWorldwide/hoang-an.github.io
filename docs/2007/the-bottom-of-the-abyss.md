# The Bottom Of The Abyss

The Bottom Of The Abyss
how deep does depth go?
how high does height reach?
how vast the measure of width?
how far does east touching west?
how clear is a sound?
how cleanse is a spirit?
how transparent is laughter?
how honest is the hidden tears?
how long will my waiting be?
how quickly will the lonely night end?
how slowly will the hands of time travel?
how soon will my love die?
forever is not a long while
for just now a thought was all there is
eternity is not uncontainable
for just now a feeling grasped hold totally
should home be the end of a journey
i am coming back to it
only after the fall
do I reach the bottom
and the abyss is just a crossing
to reach
the door that
opens to a warm
and welcoming
hearth
