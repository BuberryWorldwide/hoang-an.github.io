# Another Day Another Ride

Hoàng-Ân
Another Day Another Ride

like nervous swallows' wings, their alert feet
dance o­n the pavement of the bus terminal
youths in sportive tennis shoes jumping in the cold
cigarette smoke entwines with breaths
of february sky hidden of blending gray,
the dragon-fleet of buses loads and unloads
ragged dolls and miserable old, crippled persons
the shaking knees, the mumbling bus drivers
the multitude huddles in the metallic crisp cold air...
strangers of the same skin color greet each other,
strangers with different skin colors exchange suspicious glances
hands grasping purses shoulder bands
swinging an anonymous voice singing "Old Man River".
Just another day, another ride
some familiar faces, most retain personal silence
The same route, the same distance
Different faces etching no recognition
Eyes are to set no trespassing zone of mistrust.
