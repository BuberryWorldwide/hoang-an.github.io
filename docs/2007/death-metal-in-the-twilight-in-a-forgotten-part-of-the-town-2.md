# Death Metal In The Twilight In A Forgotten Part Of The Town (2)

Death Metal In The Twilight In A Forgotten Part Of The Town (2)

     Death Metal Dimmu Borgir's "Enthrone Darkness Triumphant" ringing the excruciating screams over the headphones of my portable CD player...in the lavender shadows...the last bright shades of the day...They strike an errie chord of hopes to cure the season of discontent! 
     Power to the few, poverty to the lot!  The inequality of the materialistic world!  Children play with disfigured worn old dolls, or kicking wantonly, wearily at empty cans other old people try to pick up and exchange for some green bills: money stinks of sweat!
      Among the hungries and homeless,
      I am the well-fed
      But feeling deeply the longing
      for food, shelter and the rare precious tender-loving-care
      for a multitude aside society's well-lit streets!
      The beginning of the month is gingerly approaching
      I too am waiting for a government check:

      But at least
      I have an address
      a mailbox
      a place to hang printed flower curtains
      a microwave oven, a gas stove, and AC
      scented candle jars, a vase of red roses
      And this here computer
      to type
      this
      here
      poem..!!
