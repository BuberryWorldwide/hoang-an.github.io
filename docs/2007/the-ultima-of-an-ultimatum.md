# THE ULTIMA OF AN ULTIMATUM

THE ULTIMA OF AN ULTIMATUM
The revocation of Your decision
for Your revisitation to my perception
about the admonition of my advocation
for a vocation concerning the formulation
in the creation of
a revision for the resuscitation
the resuscitation
of the devotion for the beautification
the beautification
of a definition for a Union:
--Without falsification, I love with caution!

(Winter 1996: ultima is a genre of English poetry in which all nouns must rhyme)
