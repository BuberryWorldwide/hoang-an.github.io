# Comedian

Comedian
a trade, a career, a genetic defect
a general view and outlook that incubate
through the eye of the select
that dissects the data of
observed details.
a stage, a stool, a lonelier's self-chosen;
and an empty ground once the
audiences
have fled, rushing toward the "Exit",
glad that it had been a good nightout
a pleasant start for the remaining of a date,
and that the comedian didn't
pick one out
for a joke.
alone in the dimness of where when
the show's over
then it will be tomorrow
to read the critics'
page of a
     might be forgotten act
:but a space in recognition
 is still a stage.
