# The Forgotten-Dreams Eaters

The Forgotten-Dreams Eaters
     To find that Height is so high in the reaching outward from the depth of the soul's abyss and to be awared of our dreams in the world of dreams that we share in the awaking moments: is to be full of wonder of the phenomenon of dreaming!
     In dreams, the intensity of emotions that colors the plot of a dream creates the effects of the experience of the dreamer.  How many dreams we dream during half a life time of sleep that we forget once awakened?  What is the function of those forgotten dreams?  Are the gods and goddesses of the in-between-world devour them?  Are they like the nectar of flowers and the honey of bees as food for the supreme beings?  Are the mortals' forgotten dreams the sacrificial feasts for the non-being beings?  As the angels are greedy for joy and peace; like the demons are for storms and shocks:  Are we not the gods and goddesses unto each other in our shared emotional realm of interacting full of the tension of conflicting expectations?
     The Id drives the oral premodial hunger and thrist that gives the powerful monmentum of blind force forcing living organisms insistently forward.  And the soul tends to love to die to the sirenesses' songs.  And the spirit lurches upon the waves of fears fighting faith.  What is civilisation without the tension of conflicting wishes and wants?!
      We want our dreams to be molded after our yearning for selfish satisfaction and the comfort of winners: we eat our dreams of emotions of both bitter and sweet like the triumph of anger and the vengence for unfulfilled need.  And we care not for failures and weaknesses: some even attempt to direct and influent sleeping dreams.  As the saying goes: "Everybody wants to go to heaven but no one is willing to die."
      May your dreams tonight be clear and sweet; and that once you've wakened up: The sun will greet you with just as clear and sweet a viewing...even in the distilled light from a sky of clouds: dream big for dream is free though priceless.
