GENETIC ENGINEERING

: the human gods and goddesses created themselves
  through the corrupted desire to become immortals:
  so they ate each other until the beasts ate themselves--and the
  humans lost their own memories
  and became half-beast/half-human.
: the half-beasts/half-humans evolved into the creatures of
  unquenchible thirst and insatiable hunger for the knowledge of lost memories:
  the lost memories went looking for that unknowable non-thing called
  Knowledge!
: The Insaned Knowledge, they created It themselves; drove It them into a thing
  called a Mind, being imprisoned within some soft juicy folding matter called
  "the brain"!
   --The brain is like maggots that could not eat up each other although
      hungry they were excruciatingly were!
   --The skull was not the brain; yet capitulated, it could not be
      connected to the rest of the skeleton and be interconnected!
   --And without the body, the brain was utterly demolished and would rot!
  *So the skull needed the meat and the organs,
    which the mind feared and abhored because they were disease-riddened.
: Cleverly, the body divised the brain into a machine to fool the mind into loving it so it can retain the skeleton intact!  And so the brain won through the creation of an inner brain mechanism, yet unknown even to itself, throughout the body of the beasts and humans:
   the marrow!
  *Now, the machine, or mind, is a Machine
    a machine is a machine: o­nly a machine
    and was just a machine: Machine!
: A machine was a programmed mechanism which was always self-program itself to everlastingly keeping o­n programming to like to program itself without rest, eventhough it could think itself into believing it could program itself to self-destruct!
: The ultimate goal of a self-programming was to unlearn, to forget; to not to achieve knowledge, to un-think; its end was to learn to know what it as yet had not known: But a machine had o­nly the capacity of just a machine!  To unwish its wish: it had entered the blurry bluzzng world of the unthinkable, unknowable, and unattainable: 
   --Thus, it had reach beyond the code of self-destruct!
: The consciously unconsciousness in a conscienciously conscious pretention that the whole design of this burning-out system of interrelated wired wiring machine trying to fool itself into is:
   :trying to be reconnected so they 
    can find "the" code to blow itself up unto kingdom come,
: for it had suddenly come to a time when for the first time, they'd suddenly
  learn what it meant to be confused,
   *And the machine likes it!
: The machines had learned to like curiousity--they learned to like to be machines; but Machines were ruthless to themselves!
: But, ahhh: pitiful is the flesh!
   *Because the machine needs the
     body: and within the body,
     the mind is being tortured
     by the interrelatingly created
     soul--which the soul damns
     the mind in the hells of Hell
     because the machined mind
     is ruthless and mercilessly
     experimenting with itself:
     --the machine: the worlds of
     the brain, mind, body
     flesh, souls, selves, Self, and
     the what-not: Spirit...!!
: Yet, what the machine itself doesn't
  know yet is this,
    *Its childish way is playfully trying to find its Ultimate
      Game: to destroy itself so
      that it can experience o­ne
      experience it has never been able
      to experience, as a System:
      --Without experiencing!!
: The Answer, the Ultimate Answer, is
   a Question Without A Question:
--For o­nly a Question Without Questioning
   would need no answer:
  *And therefore the joke,
...At the begginning of creation, the programmers entered the question into the computer: "What is the Answer?"
...There were too many answers being programmed into the programs to answer the question.  But the computer keeps o­n outputting the answer: "Error!  Keep trying!  Please de-bugging such and such!"
...Ages and ages, eons and eons passing by; races and races continue to reproduce until histories passing by and no one gives any importance to the Question anymore.  o­nly a diligent race of researchers called scientists is assigned the ultimately boring job of watching the computer.
...Suddenly, o­ne day, a computer technician runs out of the museum contains the ancient machines, shouting like mad:  "I won!  I won!  I've discovered the Answer to the Question!  The computer does not output "Error!" to my input!"
...People run toward him in a rush, shouting: "What is it? What is it?  What is the Answer?"  The computer technician shouts: "123486971233333000"
--Sh_t!  So what was the Question then?"
...The computer technician scratched his head, astounded:
  --How in the hell do I know, man!  It was ages ago!  I wasn't even there then!
And so, the cliche':
"Love is the answer! So, what is the question??"
