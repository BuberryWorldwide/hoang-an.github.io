# A Day To Do The Laundry Of My Brain

Hoàng-Ân
A Day To Do The Laundry Of My Brain
Yeah, today
I'm gonna do the laundry of my brain!
I'm gonna soak it, soak it, soak it
I'm gonna stretch it, stretch it, stretch it
I'm gonna brush it, brush it, brush it
I'm gonna shake it, shake it, shake it
I'm gonna squeeze it, squeeze it, squeeze it
I'm gonna smooth it, smooth it, smooth it
I'm gonna hang it, hang it, hang it
I'm gonna iron it, iron it, iron it
I'm gonna fold it, fold it, fold it
I'm gonna store it, store it, store it
In the compartment of my skull
Yeah, today
I have done the laundry
Of the convoluted fold
For my brain..!!
