# The Shedding

The Shedding
     If the intelligence of a flower is its fragrance, then its wisdom is the fruit it bears.  As a bud, it aches with bitter sap pumping toward by the blind force pushing forward of a restless zealot goddess named Spring.  Such pleasure that bud endures: the simmering heat of the passionate bright orange Sun; the silky caresses of frolicking breeze; the gentle mist of dews during nights whence the stars race toward the ground of this planet, oblivious of the death of their bodies; such oblivion is in the lingering dreams to spend the unquenchible desires for the receptivity of the complexes of superiority from inherent feeling of inferiority.
     :  All that aching for the explosion for the purpose to quench the hunger and thirst called the lust for total life--that which denies the meaninglessness of all manmade rules and regulations, but seethingly praising the natural Law of self-expression;
    :  All that unsuppressible swelling of selflove always searching all reasons to soon bloom, to spread out with the thinnest, most fragile petals boldly braving the unpredictable elements of nature;
    :  All that confusion between the obligation to contain seperate secrets inside a young bud, and the obligation to time to reveal its inheritance of beauty and share with the rest of existence its presence with its blooming!
     As time permits the blossom to succumb into itself and with drunkened self-involvement to unfold all its truth in its act of blooming, 'twas a life totally oblivious of time: and as such is a self-containment of the absolute!

     ...And so there comes the time to say goodbye to self-revealing: when the petals suddenly understand the meaning of the seasons, when the colors of the flower's wings, they the petals, begin to fade: when there at the heart of it manifests the pregnancy of a hardening shade of a fruit.
     ...The petals give thanks to the butterflies and bees for a time of pure fresh mirth and get ready to fall onto the waiting landing, far from their past, after they have sung their lulliby to the flower's wisdom attaining.

     So such is the forming of all fruits that self-creating after the image of the ever First Fruit: which is remembered as The Forbidden Fruit!  And what are the dreams being harbored in the fruit that shall be tasted by the teeth and the taste buds of a tongue of one who seeks temporal satisfaction of desires!?
