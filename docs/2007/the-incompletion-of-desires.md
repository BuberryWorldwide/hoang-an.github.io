# The Incompletion Of Desires

The Incompletion Of Desires
what i want is exactly what i need most
though i must already obtain the basic needs
like a shelter, clothings and food
and these social inventions that bind all of us
are like the lowest rungs of the material ladder
but it is the vases of silk flowers
the posters by Dali Dali and Vincent Van Gogh
the little figurettes, the framed family portraits
the designs of the windows' curtains
the oversize teddy bears on the bed
the scented candles and such delicate decorations
that give life to a house to become a home...
and then such things as the stereo system
that plays the music that feeds my soul
the computer that spreads my thoughts
into the virtual world of love and care
like the invisible arms of the octopus of words
reaching out to touch my loved ones
what i want is the empowerment
to be able to feel the constantly changing sky
and fleeting clouds and the leaves
the land i do not own, the house i am renting
yet the leaves that greening the trees
and the grass that embracing the wild flowers
and the birds, butterflies and bees
are for my sight to feast upon
not the fears to hide from like that of the homeless
my children speak of a utopia
where material needs do not bind time and labor
when love reigns supreme
and the absence of greed, selfishness, and all
such seeds of violence that breed wars
:are what they and i want
and what we want is the things
we most truly and dearly need.
