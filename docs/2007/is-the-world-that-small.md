Is The World That Small?
"Is the world that small?"
While my mind is exploding like a Big Bang amidst abundance with the wondrousness of existential bliss: (Which is where and how you should be too, and doing exactly what you should also be doing all the time)  I'm knee-deeped in political s_ _ _ !
...My friends lament: And the tube keeps blazing away with those mournful and indescribable innocent looks unbelievably still retaining in the eyes of children and orphants of the third world; ("accidences" for lack of electricity and entertainment while waiting for an honest job and "Peace-for-our-Fatherland") their stomachs protruding with parasites and heads the bodies scarely able to hold up, naked or without pants. (And some of my friends acclaim:) Not an infinitestimal effort is made to be more considerate for people's aesthetical sensibility for order.  "For the price of a cup of coffee a day (they calculated) you can save..."
Suddenly I have been caught off guard at the scene of the blood-and-mud caked corpses of four foreign correspondent journalists and a camera-man, lying on the gravel road along side banana-leaved and sugarcaned fields...(Wasn't this the theme being exploited for exotic sweaty sex scenes in best-seller paperback romance novels and box-office movies???):  
...They got caught between an imagined line: a line, the line, the dividing line of taking sides; their desire:  To record history for future mankind and save their human race from repeating past mistakes as time yields the judgment of history.
All the while, the archeologists and anthropologists, funded by freeworld governments of the left or non-profited private cultural sectors and the leftist regimes for "cultural propaganda" (...Cried fouled, the exiled activists and the pacifists...) keep  digging away at ancient tombs far deeper in the god-forsakened wasted lands to unearth claybaked vessels, pagan charms and fossils of bones or mummies blown bared by deserts' sandstorms; or tracing after the Eden garden in Iraq.
...How much longer can it be avoided to jargonize the confused, shaded question, "Is this morally correct?"  "Don't go there!" the pathetic crowd patted pityingly the concerner.  But the tubes are blazing still the questions amidst the tribal wars of nations while children turn orphants are starving for food and love!  And if they should grow into adults, martyrdom can deem such a better world!
