# Martyrdom Denies Suicidal Truth (2)

Martyrdom Denies Suicidal Truth (2)
      Into death dreamt the chemical suicidal wish: Instinct for happiness mixing with the fear of sorrow: Death grows and breathes from underneath the skin; the dreaming mystic tried to ply open the Pandora box lid; still cannot escape the ignorance about the point beyond.  No matter the effort to utilize the humanly limited imagination.  And the holes in between the casted net permit not the changing in the plans of the thieves.  Destiny is absolute because of the concept of purposes.  Because of life movement the bullets cannot be susspended.  Not until the force of momentum obtains its rest: 
     ...Also for beauty, the sky envelopes the green planet, not without reasons, not without seasons.
(As for wars as the insistence of a somapsychotic disease)
