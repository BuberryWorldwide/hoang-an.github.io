# Alienation From Within

Hoàng-Ân
Alienation From Within

Strange dreams breed strange yearnings.
Strange hands of dealers deal out strange part-and-parcel of peace.
Strange words mark strange emotions.
Strange concepts dye strange assumptions.
Strange creative urges force strange identifications.
Strange expectations yield strange desperations.
Strange visions forge strange attainings.
Strange shores habor strange sails.
Strange winds devastate strange penchants.
Strange things succumb strange wishes.
Strange destinies contain strange ideosyncracies.
Strange gods mold into strange beliefs.
: amidst all that
  weave
  into this strange dream of a poem
: I, me, my, mine!
