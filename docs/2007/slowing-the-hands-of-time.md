# slowing the hands of time

slowing the hands of time
...slow the hands,
           the hands
of time
...sink...sink
   the stirs of the
           the pines
   in the wind
   of change...
...hide the dreams
   the lustful
          imagination
in the breath
of dewdrops in
          the night
...greeting in
another dawn
blushing of
         scarlet red
the cheek
against the pillow
trying to hold fast
to
        the dream
last night
...and to kiss softly
        the roses' 
        petals
telling the morning
        birds to sing
the songs of love...

...to wait for
        the night
of dreams...
