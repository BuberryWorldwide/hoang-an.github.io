# Island of Emerald Green

Island of Emerald Green
gypsy girl with flowing octopus hair
and ringing bracelets
earings and necklaces of seashells
skirt the color of aquarius
ankles with chiming bells
on an island of emerald green ocean water
she strums her guitar
and sings in sireness haunting voice
voice floating like slippery mermaids' tails
smiles of seaweeds wet and resilient
tears salty in bubbling sea foams
she's calling backward to her first love
that she has had to leave behind
she's singing the song for who she is
and wishing she has the fortune in love
like Ariel the Little Mermaid

life has the habit of erasing out
old memories
she can still recall his face though
and the kisses she has drunk from his lips
and the waves forever crashing
against the shore
caressing the shifting sands
and the wind never stays
to wed the infidel the foam
all will flow forward with time
only the gypsy girl
tries to preserve her memories
in the songs she weaves...
