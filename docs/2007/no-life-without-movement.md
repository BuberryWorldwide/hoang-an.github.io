# No Life Without Movement

No Life Without Movement
the wind, if noticed, has many sways, and
is constantly changing direction...
the fire in the core of the globe
is everlastingly burning and steaming its skin
as the planet swings itself for-toward in space
: there is swimming and floating and flying,
from Movement,
alas
cometh life!
Prometheus's apple-of-the-eye:
-"Knowledge"
moves the nerves, furnaces the creases of consciousness,
into steel of the heart
and gold of the soul.
