# Alluring Phantom

Hoàng-Ân
Alluring Phantom

the sky is not there
the ground has ceased to be
and the misty fog hangs low
...what would touch you
for my heart?
in here, flowers bleed
the moon cries
and nights weep
the day escapes into rebellion
oblivion is oblivious
and remembrance seeks after
    merciful forgetfulness

I stand amidst nothing
so my being can feel out
    the alluring
    phantom of my heart
distance is bound by the illusive horizon
time is bound by the hands of man-made clocks
the heart is bound by physical limitations
the mind is bound by the relative strength of imagination.
...the alluring phantom in me, though
breaks all rules and boundaries
and the reality of relative realities
seeps deep into the core of
the meaning of elusive dreams of
:The Kiss of mist upon misty lips!
