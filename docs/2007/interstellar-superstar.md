# INTERSTELLAR SUPERSTAR

INTERSTELLAR SUPERSTAR
Within deep, dark, mysterious interstellar's untold sadness,
Absorbed Emission Nebula sob and cry with determination.
Reflection Nebula whirl, otherwise, aimlessly through space, vast...
   Ages relentlessly swim casually without spoken empathy,
   ...Planet this ever so unyieldingly takes form!
Out of Paleolithic, Neolithic, and then what we so-called Civilization
come the Cultural Man and the Cultural Woman,
Once again, only catering to what we have decided to so called.
But I am a Rock-and-Roll star: In the Information Age's Super Freeway of the twenty-first century modern U.S.A:  Within the depth and height of sounds, I was barred!  Moving without movement of the corporeal machine-like Form,
   In my own mind: I'm a star, my very own Superstar!
A Star to shine to bright my blinded eyes; A Star to while away the moments of my whiles!
Incident radiation, absorbed or reflected, for future and being nebula: nebulously, my Music, so arresting, so to it I sing:
   "Toils and snares! Trials and tribulations!"
I'm deaf, blind, and dumb:
But the cosmic consciousness swirls with the rhythm
of my body: the machine:                       
                                    Machine!
and its Form and Ideal dance with the arrangement of my DNA,
   So I'm a Star, a star!
