# Temporary Santuary

Temporary Santuary
     It's gonna be such a long lonely time: long will still be my journey through the vast and boundless stark wild beauty of the turbulous endless landscape of the wilderness of my struggling soul: ...'till we are once again beholding each other's faces to share our joy and delightful laughters; hand-in-hand walking down the broad avenues of the loveliest town we once called our "Home": the home that bears witness to our love story: that which no matter how far apart we are, we ever hold on to with our very dearest life!
     It's gonna be such a long lonely drive, 'till the wheel of time draws us closest to each other that also erases the distance that has kept us apart.  Still, until then: empty days and sobbing nights: when our restless spirits and our tormented souls fight the relentless wars that each one has to face alone: Because that is the school of Life's motto: "There is no other way!" : Oh, the dark battle fields which our race has been facing since the beginning of our existence: So we can admit to our sameness in our separate fates, in the faith in our commonness of advocating our separate peacehood-dom!
     It's gonna be a long and rough journey, 'till we are One again! ...Back to share our tales in the Garden of temporary resting: where we are a herd of wounded souls: each licking his and her own wounds; separately in the shades of the same garden canopy of gentle oblivion: then pair by pair, tasting the beloved's putrified tears.
     Oh! The Separate Peace!  The principles our humaness denied: Together in a distinctive recognition and acknowledgement of our sameness: in the awaking moment of the aloneness in hopes and fears!
