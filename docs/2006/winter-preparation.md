# Winter Preparation

Winter Preparation
Golden threads and red gossamer
Dragons, bird-of-paradises and
Black mums of chrysanthemum
Aching green ferns and weeping willow leaves
Yellow bamboos with Pandas clinging among
the patient eucalyptic branches
: The cloth I weave to sew you your coạt

        Winter is coming
         among the dripping clouds
         blurring the horizons between
         secret worlds.
         I am waiting with hurrying patience
         to fulfill your image in me
         Reverence is a delicate gesture
         to profess in a performance.
Sweet violets and simple daisies paint the field
Lavender blooms bleed innocently passionate into the season
I remind their presence upon the design of the cloth
Into the loom I feed the deep wisdom of purple sunset clouds
And with ancient colors and court courtesy
I sew a coat
For you to keep your warmth
While from afar
I feel the validation for the justification
for all my trials and tribulations.
