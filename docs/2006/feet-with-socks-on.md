# Feet With Socks On

Feet With Socks On
Boddha Dahrma scratched
his disciples'
souls.
But my feet are stuck to my socks
and the itches in my brain
get no relief
from my numbed fingers!

Todd Rundgren sings, "Izzat Love?"
I can barely remember
what it is to be in love!

Once when I still had dreams, 
Once divorced from the system,
     three times  
     indulging in the passion of heat
I find out what I don't need...
But what I want is
to
feel
something manifesting from the
abstract idea of true
love!
...Only, O,
so heavy is my
self-involved soul
like the soles
in so heavy are
the shoes!
