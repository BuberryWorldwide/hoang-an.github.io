# The Pearl Necklace

The Pearl Necklace
Reaching backward into memory dense and thick
I feel the poems from those days of chaotic insanity:
One speaks of a foam meeting her beloved wave
and he takes her onto the journey to meet her destiny.
One speaks of eternity in grains of sand
that hide each others' secret songs
inside the heart of the desert's wild red moon.
One speaks of a lonely ancient sandalwood tree
reaching upward longing to kiss the star that she's loved.
One speaks of dreams like pearls stringing on a necklace
that decoration is like picking out the pain to show.
One speaks of hope like fluttering hair of a dancing queen
floating forward to meet the purple shirt on the broad back
of her one-night-stand handsome dream date of the week.
Such is the kaleidoscope hourglass of my mind
And images from emotions like colored sands
Squeezing through the narrow neck into strange designs
Tapestries of lives in the life shaped for me by the flow of time
Myriad forms and shapes of stories weaved
Depiction of the immense attempt at giving order
To the chaos given in convoluted currents of confusion
And today the poems reach out like arms of an octopus around me
I exploded in them and time escapes the confinement and spreads
like rich wet paints onto the canvas of surprise!
I can't hide from them, the selves that sob
with lavish tears of joy from the pain they rob
to give forms to their destined creative urge!
So here's my pearl necklace,
The pain I've picked to wear to the show tonight!
