# The Strong Silent Presence

The Strong Silent Presence
Strong and Silent
Your Presence
       in my life
       my stormy
       inner world
Always,
Yield such strength
       a pillar
       a simmer
          warmth
       of the hearth
       fire flame
burning soft and tender
Inside of me,
An unfathomable, bottomless
wild ocean of dark storms
rages relentlessly
My small boat crosses it
My sail is thin and weak
The wind and waves
forever directionless:
But Your Ever Silent Presence
lies deep within my Heart
that is hidden inside
the embrace of my
enclosed chest:
This is my Destination
and I no longer
afraid of being lost!
I am already: HOME..!!
