# Where Is My Baby?

Where Is My Baby?
No milk today
My kitty is gone
Someone has stolen her
Or did she just leave me?

No guitar playing today
My baby is gone
Someone has tempted him away
Or has he just left me?
Today:
No guitar playing!
The drawer is still full of his socks
Where has he gone?

No tears today
My best friends are gone
Life has moved them on
Beyond my horizon...
No use crying alone.
Today:
no more changing the litter
no songs to ignore the
wrong keys in the tuning!
My heart is still beating
Where has the reminder to listen to it gone?
Where has the gladened listening to it gone?
It will rain tonight, the forecast has predicted
Will my tears, like the rain,  pour down upon
on the rooms of a house that is no longer a home!
