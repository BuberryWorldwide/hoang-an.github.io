# Love Is Closer Than A Thought

Love Is Closer Than A Thought

Love is stronger than fear.  Love is lighter than gladness.  Love is more binding than a vow.  Love is more certain than prayers.
Love is nearer than the telephone. Love is warmer than the front door bell ringing.  Love is more promising than the hot homecook meal. Love is softer than the pillow cradling the drowsy head.
Love is tighter than the heartbeat in love. Love is higher than a hit.  Love is purer than liquor.  Love is deeper than a sob.
Love is closer than a thought. Love is more soothing than a note. Love is richer than a poem. Love is swifter than a lightning striking. Love is more compassionate than a shared bonfire amidst the wilderness.
Love is more comforting than an embrace. Love is more enduring than a touch. Love is more certain than a promise. Love is more lasting than the most lingering look.
Love is more than you-and-I. Love means more than just an us.  Love is kinder than a smile.  Love is more abiding than a kiss.
Love is mild like a star burning through time and space, enduring in darkness like faith and belief; firmly shining bright like direction: in the emptiness of cold, indifferent vastness of space.  It shines o­n long and longer than the longest time...after its body has gone!
