# Renewing Hope

Renewing Hope
Don't lead the music
only let the music guide you
You will see the tender grass and purple daisies
dotting the verdant vista
You will feel the lustful leaves bound thristy summer
You will be colored by the golden and moroon hues
dipping by autumn's dawns and dusks
And winter snows and icycles
will leave you a sensibility of Life's patience
     as the God of the seasons
     silently mystifying our
     Oneness
     into another Spring.
