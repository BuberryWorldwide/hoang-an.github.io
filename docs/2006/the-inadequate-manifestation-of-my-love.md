# The Inadequate Manifestation Of My Love

The Inadequate Manifestation Of My Love
Hi LuiKang...
Autumn flows by my town with the juxtapose of cold rainy and bleak days and softly cold days rich with golden liquid honey sunshine: and as always as I walk in the blessed paradise of our green planet Earth, observing how like a character I am in a musical movie that I can choose to change the setting by picking the CD to play with my portable CD player!  And I bless my Creator and praise Him when He puts into my inner eyes Your Image within the movie you are living and loving in in the city of your refuge!  So like the words I choose to express to you my love for you is me as the manifestation of my Creator of His blessed love for you.  But like my words cannot wholly express my feeling for you is my inadequacy in the manifestion for the expressing of His Love for you in using me!
MISER WORDS SO ARE JUST W O R D S
.....................................Hoàng-Ân........
Words, they are so  just w o r d s
like a ribbon I put on a wrapped present for you
I pick it with minute attention to details
As the finishing touch
like dedicating an exclamation mark to a sentence
to reach you deeper
and make known the feeling!
They are never enough!
The invisible things filling up all the invisible me's
They strive to touch and move you into understanding
The intensity they have to bear
This wish in itself is intensity enough!
And words, they are such misers,
Never enough!
Just like the ribbon
I pick out with such concentrations as
the finishing touch of my offering present unto you
Even the colors
Requiring so much pondering
But
W O R D S
:They are never enough!
