# Hoà ng-Ân: A Self-Portrait

Hoàng-Ân: A Self-Portrait
Black is rage and white is puree' goat cheese,
Cheeezy chips are fat but fatness is white and greesy-
Black and white are Art,
But art itself is not an artist.
Space is art but Art surpasses space-
Blind is suffering but suffering shouldn't be blinded.
Sea sees eyes but eyes are not Space,
Space is stoned but drugs need not be stoned.
A rock should roll
because mosses need to be rolled.
Half a loaf of bread is truth
but half of truth is not bread itself-
Selves are good in themselves
but the Self cannot be drugged.
