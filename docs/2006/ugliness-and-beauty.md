# Ugliness and Beauty

Ugliness and Beauty
In the face of Life
I'm struggling with my aesthetic sensibility
It's hard to look at myself
in the mirror, sometimes
For I see on it
the ugliness of myself in mankind
But to be able to forgive is beauty,
too!
The Dharma teaches
to transcend judgement of
things ephemeral
Only when I can accept
that I am only another part
of the rest of my race
one among others on the ship-of-fools
and pardon my own follies
and foolishness

Can I attain peace-of-mind
and able to live with
others and myself
