# Green Green Thread of Hope

Green Green Thread of Hope
          a string tied tightly
          from one doorknob to the other
          across the interior of my room
          i have been waiting to see
          which door would be opened,
          one opens outward, one inward
          like the resiliency of the meek
          i am holding my breath in suspension
          you walk in,
          the string snaps
