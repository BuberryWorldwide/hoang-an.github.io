# I have seen perfection in my Beloved

Hoang-An

I HAVE SEEN PERFECTION IN MY BELOVED


Shadows dance, the crimson fire sings
Candle light, the romancing with the night,
From the open window, the breeze weaves a composition
The fluttering leaves and the crickets, a symphony arousing.

Thy beauty, unto my eyes so resplendent
etching against darkness thy image conjured up in my breath
through thy voice, O! music gains form
leaves my soul mourning so forlorn
Wanting you, a touch and a kiss
Comforting words, the divine notes of tender-loving-care..!!

Adonis, whose beauty is a myth
Has thus from ancient time till now dares the artists' wit
In competition to fortify his grace:
Yet, thy beauty is true to my eyes
The sudden inspiration for my lost love a-rekindled..!!
No..!!  Truly..!!  Adonis is thee, my Beloved..!!
If I should be lacking in talent
Thy genius lends me my psalms and hymns
Such sweet words enchanted by thy name
Charmed hues by thy deep smiling eyes
like the blue flame of the the ocean and the open sky
My love for thee, shall I have to hide..!?!?

The night is long and the stars are weeping
The deathly task the moths are daring
unto the candle's fire, a-raging
And as I am watching, I feel a kindredship a flighting,

... Loving silently is the heart's sealed fate:
O..!! My Beloved: I have fallen in love with your perfection..!!
