# Violets Are Blue

Hoang-An

Violets Are Blue


He did say he loved me,
and gave his roses to bluer eyes.
He did make me promises,
And danced with another at the ball all night.

Since you come, you give me violets.
Since you come, you never make any vows.
Yet, you give me all your kind smiles.
Yet, you hold me every time I cry.
You never tell me that you love me,
But when I look into your eyes
I hear a thousand wind whispering
and the stars speak for you
in laughter sparkling of roses and wine..!!

Come without a promise, you haven't made yet a vow,
But since you come I believe in eternity.
And I no longer afraid of the dreams in the dark of nights.
For I am cocooned within your embrace;
And enclosed within your warmth.
Your gentle voice singing me to sweet sleep.
Your soft caresses calming my anxious mind.

Ever since you come into my life,
Life is sweet and kind.
Ever since you enter my world,
Love is full of hope and joy.

True love and caring is for me, for me..!!
True love and caring is for me, for me..!!
Empty words and vain promises
Not for me..!! Not for me..!!
