# The Meager Scheduled Time

Hoang-An

The Meager Scheduled Time

Time flows by silently
With ardous labor in love
Those cling to the noise and the illusion of action
Stingily count the number of hair turning white
And paint the shadow of regret
Upon the lines of wrinkles o­n the skin
Cannot feel the caresses of the future..!!

Like the eyesight ends at the illusive horizon
The feet swiftly skipping the cracks o­n the sidewalk
And hungrily chase after victories
And mistook fulfilled ambition for laughter..!!

But Time loves, oh, how Time loves
us all: the drunkened racers
And the lingerring steps out o­n a walk beneath the stars
It lets the silhoulette of the night
Carries the sleepers across the threshold of rationality
Into the landscape of enigmatic dreams
And reminds us that the mind
Should be the laborer for the heart
Only the heart can take the dreamers
Back to the original purpose
Of living and loving LIFE true to its own meaning..!!

Time will wake up the dreaming race
To know how precious is LOVE
In honest tears that spark into joy
Waiting is not the same as patient awareness
And getting there hurrily
Does not equate with the actuallity of finally being there..!!

A watch or a clock
Sometimes chokes consciousness
With the nuts-and-bolts of a machine
Only in the sound of a rushing stream
In the murmurs of the tall green pines
On the mountains that are the witnesses of mortality
Can take the Heart back to an immense realization
That until it hears TIME's love in its beating
It has not yet fulfilled the meaning of LOVE
That it's been known to be a symbol of..!!

And the Heart that can be felt
To feel that LOVE that TIME harbors
Is the final awaking into
The vast silent immensely absolute Mystery
of Death, of Life, and the story of Love
Resurrecting in the hurrying of
Inviolatable belief in TRUE LOVE..!!
